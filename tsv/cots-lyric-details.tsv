TSW:01:001:V	He said the way my blue eyes shined
TSW:01:002:V	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
TSW:01:003:V	I said, "That's a lie"
TSW:01:004:V	Just a boy in a Chevy truck
TSW:01:005:V	That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
TSW:01:006:V	On backroads at night
TSW:01:007:C	And I was right there beside him all summer long
TSW:01:008:C	And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
TSW:01:009:C	But when you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:010:C	I hope you think my favorite song
TSW:01:011:C	The one we danced to all night long
TSW:01:012:C	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
TSW:01:013:C	When you think happiness
TSW:01:014:C	I hope you think that little black dress
TSW:01:015:C	Think of my head on your chest
TSW:01:016:C	And my old faded blue jeans
TSW:01:017:C	When you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:018:C	I hope you think of me
TSW:01:019:V	September saw a month of tears
TSW:01:020:V	And thankin' god that you weren't here
TSW:01:021:V	To see me like that
TSW:01:022:V	But in a box beneath my bed
TSW:01:023:V	Is a letter that you never read
TSW:01:024:V	From three summers back
TSW:01:025:C	It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
TSW:01:026:C	And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
TSW:01:027:C	When you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:028:C	I hope you think my favorite song
TSW:01:029:C	The one we danced to all night long
TSW:01:030:C	The moon like a spotlight on the lake
TSW:01:031:C	When you think happiness
TSW:01:032:C	I hope you think that little black dress
TSW:01:033:C	Think of my head on your chest
TSW:01:034:C	And my old faded blue jeans
TSW:01:035:C	When you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:036:C	I hope you think of me
TSW:01:037:B	And I'm back for the first time since then
TSW:01:038:B	I'm standin' on your street
TSW:01:039:B	And there's a letter left on your doorstep
TSW:01:040:B	And the first thing that you'll read
TSW:01:041:C	Is, "When you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:042:C	I hope you think my favorite song
TSW:01:043:C	Someday you'll turn your radio on
TSW:01:044:C	I hope it takes you back to that place"
TSW:01:045:C	When you think happiness
TSW:01:046:C	I hope you think that little black dress
TSW:01:047:C	Think of my head on your chest
TSW:01:048:C	And my old faded blue jeans
TSW:01:049:C	When you think Tim-McGraw
TSW:01:050:C	I hope you think of me
TSW:01:051:I	Oh, think of me, mmm
TSW:01:052:I	He said the way my blue eyes shined
TSW:01:053:I	Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
TSW:01:054:I	I said, "That's a lie"
TSW:02:001:V	State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
TSW:02:002:V	I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
TSW:02:003:V	So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
TSW:02:004:V	That's fine, you won't mind if I say
TSW:02:005:V	By the way
TSW:02:006:C	I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
TSW:02:007:C	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
TSW:02:008:C	So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
TSW:02:009:C	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
TSW:02:010:V	There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
TSW:02:011:V	There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
TSW:02:012:V	And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
TSW:02:013:V	My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
TSW:02:014:C	'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
TSW:02:015:C	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
TSW:02:016:C	So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
TSW:02:017:C	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
TSW:02:018:B	And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
TSW:02:019:B	'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
TSW:02:020:C	'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
TSW:02:021:C	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
TSW:02:022:C	So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
TSW:02:023:C	In case you haven't heard
TSW:02:024:C	I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
TSW:02:025:C	You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
TSW:02:026:C	So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
TSW:02:027:C	As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
TSW:02:028:I	Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
TSW:02:029:I	You're just another picture to burn
TSW:02:030:I	Baby, burn
TSW:03:001:V	Drew looks at me
TSW:03:002:V	I fake a smile so he won't see
TSW:03:003:V	That I want and I'm needing
TSW:03:004:V	Everything that we should be
TSW:03:005:C	I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
TSW:03:006:C	And she's got everything that I have to live without
TSW:03:007:V	Drew talks to me
TSW:03:008:V	I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
TSW:03:009:V	That I can't even see
TSW:03:010:V	Anyone when he's with me
TSW:03:011:C	He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
TSW:03:012:C	I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
TSW:03:013:C	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
TSW:03:014:C	The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
TSW:03:015:C	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
TSW:03:016:V	Drew walks by me
TSW:03:017:V	Can he tell that I can't breathe?
TSW:03:018:V	And there he goes, so perfectly
TSW:03:019:V	The kind of flawless I wish I could be
TSW:03:020:C	She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
TSW:03:021:C	Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
TSW:03:022:C	He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
TSW:03:023:C	The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
TSW:03:024:C	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
TSW:03:025:C	So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
TSW:03:026:C	I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
TSW:03:027:C	'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
TSW:03:028:C	The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
TSW:03:029:C	He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
TSW:03:030:I	He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
TSW:03:031:I	And he's all that I need to fall into
TSW:03:032:I	Drew looks at me
TSW:03:033:I	I fake a smile, so he won't see
TSW:04:001:V	I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
TSW:04:002:V	'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
TSW:04:003:V	Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
TSW:04:004:V	Trying to see through the rain coming down
TSW:04:005:V	Even though I'm not the only one
TSW:04:006:V	Who feels the way I do
TSW:04:007:C	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
TSW:04:008:C	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
TSW:04:009:C	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
TSW:04:010:V	Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
TSW:04:011:V	And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
TSW:04:012:V	Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
TSW:04:013:V	Could you tell me what more do I need?
TSW:04:014:V	And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
TSW:04:015:V	But that's okay
TSW:04:016:C	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
TSW:04:017:C	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
TSW:04:018:C	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
TSW:04:019:B	Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
TSW:04:020:B	But I'm ready to fly
TSW:04:021:C	I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
TSW:04:022:C	I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
TSW:04:023:C	Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
TSW:04:024:C	Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
TSW:04:025:I	Oh, I'm just a girl
TSW:04:026:I	Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
TSW:04:027:I	Oh, I'm just a girl
TSW:05:001:V	You have a way of coming easily to me
TSW:05:002:V	And when you take, you take the very best of me
TSW:05:003:V	So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
TSW:05:004:V	And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
TSW:05:005:C	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
TSW:05:006:C	Given to a perfect day
TSW:05:007:C	Just walk away, ain't no use defending
TSW:05:008:C	Words that you will never say
TSW:05:009:C	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
TSW:05:010:C	I've never been anywhere cold as you
TSW:05:011:V	You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
TSW:05:012:V	And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
TSW:05:013:V	And you come away with a great little story
TSW:05:014:V	Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
TSW:05:015:C	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
TSW:05:016:C	Given to a perfect day
TSW:05:017:C	So just walk away, ain't no use defending
TSW:05:018:C	Words that you will never say
TSW:05:019:C	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
TSW:05:020:C	I've never been anywhere cold as you
TSW:05:021:B	You never did give a damn thing, honey
TSW:05:022:B	But I cried, cried for you
TSW:05:023:B	And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
TSW:05:024:B	If I died, died for you, died for you
TSW:05:025:C	Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
TSW:05:026:C	Given to a perfect day, oh
TSW:05:027:C	Every smile you fake is so condescending
TSW:05:028:C	Counting all the scars you made
TSW:05:029:C	And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
TSW:05:030:C	I've never been anywhere cold as you
TSW:05:031:C	Ooh-oh
TSW:06:001:V	I didn't know what I would find
TSW:06:002:V	When I went looking for a reason, I know
TSW:06:003:V	I didn't read between the lines
TSW:06:004:V	And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
TSW:06:005:C	I tried to take the road less traveled by
TSW:06:006:C	But nothing seems to work the first few times
TSW:06:007:C	Am I right?
TSW:06:008:C	So how can I ever try to be better?
TSW:06:009:C	Nobody ever lets me in
TSW:06:010:C	I can still see you, this ain't the best view
TSW:06:011:C	On the outside looking in
TSW:06:012:C	I've been a lot of lonely places
TSW:06:013:C	I've never been on the outside
TSW:06:014:V	You saw me there, but never knew
TSW:06:015:V	That I would give it all up to be
TSW:06:016:V	A part of this, a part of you
TSW:06:017:V	And now, it's all too late, so you see
TSW:06:018:C	You could've helped if you had wanted to
TSW:06:019:C	But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
TSW:06:020:C	How can I ever try to be better?
TSW:06:021:C	Nobody ever lets me in
TSW:06:022:C	I can still see you, this ain't the best view
TSW:06:023:C	On the outside looking in
TSW:06:024:C	I've been a lot of lonely places
TSW:06:025:C	I've never been on the outside
TSW:06:026:C	Oh, yeah
TSW:06:027:C	How can I ever try to be better?
TSW:06:028:C	Nobody ever lets me in
TSW:06:029:C	And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
TSW:06:030:C	On the outside looking in
TSW:06:031:C	I've been a lot of lonely places
TSW:06:032:C	I've never been on the outside
TSW:06:033:I	Oh-oh
TSW:06:034:I	Oh, oh-oh
TSW:06:035:I	Oh-oh
TSW:06:036:I	Oh-oh
TSW:07:001:V	Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
TSW:07:002:V	Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
TSW:07:003:V	You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
TSW:07:004:V	But that's not true
TSW:07:005:V	'Cause I know you
TSW:07:006:C	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
TSW:07:007:C	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
TSW:07:008:C	And no one knows
TSW:07:009:C	That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
TSW:07:010:C	That you might not be the golden one
TSW:07:011:C	And you're tied together with a smile
TSW:07:012:C	But you're coming undone, oh
TSW:07:013:V	I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
TSW:07:014:V	'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
TSW:07:015:V	Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
TSW:07:016:V	But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
TSW:07:017:V	Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
TSW:07:018:V	It's not his price to pay
TSW:07:019:C	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
TSW:07:020:C	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
TSW:07:021:C	And no one knows
TSW:07:022:C	That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
TSW:07:023:C	That you might not be the golden one
TSW:07:024:C	And you're tied together with a smile
TSW:07:025:C	But you're coming undone, oh
TSW:07:026:C	Oh, oh
TSW:07:027:C	Hold on, baby, you're losing it
TSW:07:028:C	The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
TSW:07:029:C	And no one knows
TSW:07:030:C	That you cry but you don't tell anyone
TSW:07:031:C	That you might not be the golden one
TSW:07:032:C	And you're tied together with a smile
TSW:07:033:C	But you're coming undone, oh
TSW:07:034:I	You're tied together with a smile
TSW:07:035:I	But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
TSW:07:036:I	Goodbye, baby
TSW:07:037:I	With a smile, baby, baby
TSW:07:038:I	Oh
TSW:08:001:V	Cory's eyes are like a jungle
TSW:08:002:V	He smiles, it's like the radio
TSW:08:003:V	He whispers songs into my window
TSW:08:004:V	In words that nobody knows
TSW:08:005:V	There's pretty girls on every corner
TSW:08:006:V	They watch him as he's walking home
TSW:08:007:V	Saying, "Does he know?"
TSW:08:008:V	Will you ever know?
TSW:08:009:C	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
TSW:08:010:C	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
TSW:08:011:C	Ask anyone
TSW:08:012:C	And when you find everything you looked for
TSW:08:013:C	I hope your life leads you back to my door
TSW:08:014:C	Oh, but if it don't
TSW:08:015:C	Stay beautiful
TSW:08:016:V	Cory finds another way to be
TSW:08:017:V	The highlight of my day
TSW:08:018:V	I'm taking pictures in my mind
TSW:08:019:V	So I can save 'em for a rainy day
TSW:08:020:V	It's hard to make a conversation
TSW:08:021:V	When he's taking my breath away
TSW:08:022:V	I should say, "Hey, by the way"
TSW:08:023:C	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
TSW:08:024:C	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
TSW:08:025:C	Ask anyone
TSW:08:026:C	And when you find everything you looked for
TSW:08:027:C	I hope your life leads you back to my door
TSW:08:028:C	Oh, but if it don't
TSW:08:029:C	Stay beautiful
TSW:08:030:B	If you and I are a story
TSW:08:031:B	That never gets told
TSW:08:032:B	If what you are is a daydream
TSW:08:033:B	I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
TSW:08:034:C	You're beautiful, every little piece, love
TSW:08:035:C	Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
TSW:08:036:C	Ask anyone
TSW:08:037:C	And when you find everything you looked for
TSW:08:038:C	I hope your life leads you back to my front door
TSW:08:039:C	Oh, but if it don't
TSW:08:040:C	Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
TSW:08:041:C	Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
TSW:08:042:I	La-la-la
TSW:08:043:I	Oh-oh-oh
TSW:08:044:I	Oh-oh-oh-oh
TSW:08:045:I	Oh, but if it don't
TSW:08:046:I	Stay beautiful, stay beautiful
TSW:08:047:I	Na-na-na, na-na
TSW:09:001:V	It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
TSW:09:002:V	The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
TSW:09:003:V	Yesterday, I found out about you
TSW:09:004:V	Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
TSW:09:005:C	You say that you'd take it all back
TSW:09:006:C	Given one chance
TSW:09:007:C	It was a moment of weakness
TSW:09:008:C	And you said yes
TSW:09:009:C	You should've said no, you should've gone home
TSW:09:010:C	You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
TSW:09:011:C	You should've known that word
TSW:09:012:C	'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
TSW:09:013:C	And I should've been there in the back of your mind
TSW:09:014:C	I shouldn't be asking myself why
TSW:09:015:C	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
TSW:09:016:C	You should've said no
TSW:09:017:C	Baby, and you might still have me
TSW:09:018:V	You can see that I've been cryin'
TSW:09:019:V	And baby, you know all the right things to say
TSW:09:020:V	But do you honestly expect me to believe
TSW:09:021:V	We could ever be the same?
TSW:09:022:C	You say that the past is the past
TSW:09:023:C	You need one chance
TSW:09:024:C	It was a moment of weakness
TSW:09:025:C	And you said yes
TSW:09:026:C	You should've said no, you should've gone home
TSW:09:027:C	You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
TSW:09:028:C	You should've known that word
TSW:09:029:C	'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
TSW:09:030:C	And I should've been there in the back of your mind
TSW:09:031:C	I shouldn't be asking myself why
TSW:09:032:C	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
TSW:09:033:C	You should've said no
TSW:09:034:C	Baby, and you might still have me
TSW:09:035:C	Oh, oh
TSW:09:036:B	I can't resist
TSW:09:037:B	Before you go, tell me this
TSW:09:038:B	Was it worth it?
TSW:09:039:B	Was she worth this?
TSW:09:040:B	No, no
TSW:09:041:B	No, no, no, no
TSW:09:042:C	You should've said no, you should've gone home
TSW:09:043:C	You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
TSW:09:044:C	You should've known that word
TSW:09:045:C	'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
TSW:09:046:C	And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
TSW:09:047:C	I shouldn't be asking myself why
TSW:09:048:C	You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
TSW:09:049:C	You should've said no
TSW:09:050:C	Baby, and you might still have me
TSW:10:001:V	She said I was seven and you were nine
TSW:10:002:V	I looked at you like the stars that shined
TSW:10:003:V	In the sky, the pretty lights
TSW:10:004:V	And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
TSW:10:005:V	Growing up and falling in love
TSW:10:006:V	And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
TSW:10:007:V	And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
TSW:10:008:C	Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
TSW:10:009:C	Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
TSW:10:010:C	You never did, you never did
TSW:10:011:C	Take me back when our world was one block wide
TSW:10:012:C	I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
TSW:10:013:C	Just two kids, you and I
TSW:10:014:C	Oh, my, my, my, my
TSW:10:015:V	Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
TSW:10:016:V	I wasn't that little girl you used to see
TSW:10:017:V	But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
TSW:10:018:V	And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
TSW:10:019:V	They never believed we'd really fall in love
TSW:10:020:V	And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
TSW:10:021:V	And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
TSW:10:022:C	Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
TSW:10:023:C	2AM riding in your truck
TSW:10:024:C	And all I need is you next to me
TSW:10:025:C	Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
TSW:10:026:C	The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
TSW:10:027:C	You stayed outside 'til the morning light
TSW:10:028:C	Oh, my, my, my, my
TSW:10:029:B	A few years had gone and come around
TSW:10:030:B	We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
TSW:10:031:B	And you looked at me, got down on one knee
TSW:10:032:C	Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
TSW:10:033:C	Our whole town came and our mamas cried
TSW:10:034:C	You said, "I do," and I did, too
TSW:10:035:C	Take me home where we met so many years before
TSW:10:036:C	We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
TSW:10:037:C	After all this time, you and I
TSW:10:038:I	And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
TSW:10:039:I	I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
TSW:10:040:I	In the sky, oh, my, my, my
TSW:11:001:V	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
TSW:11:002:V	In the front seat of his car
TSW:11:003:V	He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
TSW:11:004:V	The other on my heart
TSW:11:005:V	I look around, turn the radio down
TSW:11:006:V	He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
TSW:11:007:V	I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
TSW:11:008:V	How we don't have a song"
TSW:11:009:V	And he says
TSW:11:010:C	Our song is a slamming screen door
TSW:11:011:C	Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
TSW:11:012:C	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
TSW:11:013:C	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
TSW:11:014:C	Our song is the way you laugh
TSW:11:015:C	The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
TSW:11:016:C	And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
TSW:11:017:C	Askin' god if he could play it again
TSW:11:018:V	I was walking up the front porch steps
TSW:11:019:V	After everything that day
TSW:11:020:V	Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
TSW:11:021:V	And lost and thrown away
TSW:11:022:V	Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
TSW:11:023:V	I almost didn't notice all the roses
TSW:11:024:V	And the note that said
TSW:11:025:C	Our song is a slamming screen door
TSW:11:026:C	Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
TSW:11:027:C	When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
TSW:11:028:C	'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
TSW:11:029:C	Our song is the way you laugh
TSW:11:030:C	The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
TSW:11:031:C	And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
TSW:11:032:C	Askin' god if he could play it again
TSW:11:033:C	Da-da-da-da
TSW:11:034:B	I've heard every album, listened to the radio
TSW:11:035:B	Waited for somethin' to come along
TSW:11:036:B	That was as good as our song
TSW:11:037:C	'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
TSW:11:038:C	Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
TSW:11:039:C	When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
TSW:11:040:C	'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
TSW:11:041:C	Our song is the way he laughs
TSW:11:042:C	The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have"
TSW:11:043:C	And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
TSW:11:044:C	Askin' god if he could play it again
TSW:11:045:C	Play it again, oh yeah
TSW:11:046:C	Oh-oh, yeah
TSW:11:047:I	I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
TSW:11:048:I	In the front seat of his car
TSW:11:049:I	I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
TSW:11:050:I	And I wrote down our song
TSW:12:001:V	Friday night beneath the stars
TSW:12:002:V	In a field behind your yard
TSW:12:003:V	You and I are painting pictures in the sky
TSW:12:004:V	And sometimes, we don't say a thing
TSW:12:005:V	Just listen to the crickets sing
TSW:12:006:V	Everything I need is right here by my side
TSW:12:007:C	And I know everything about you
TSW:12:008:C	I don't wanna live without you
TSW:12:009:C	I'm only up when you're not down
TSW:12:010:C	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
TSW:12:011:C	It's like no matter what I do
TSW:12:012:C	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
TSW:12:013:C	The other half, I'm only tryin' to
TSW:12:014:C	Let you know that what I feel is true
TSW:12:015:C	And I'm only me when I'm with you
TSW:12:016:V	Just a small-town boy and girl
TSW:12:017:V	Livin' in a crazy world
TSW:12:018:V	Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
TSW:12:019:V	And I don't try to hide my tears
TSW:12:020:V	My secrets or my deepest fears
TSW:12:021:V	Through it all, nobody gets me like you do
TSW:12:022:C	And you know everything about me
TSW:12:023:C	You say that you can't live without me
TSW:12:024:C	I'm only up when you're not down
TSW:12:025:C	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
TSW:12:026:C	It's like no matter what I do
TSW:12:027:C	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
TSW:12:028:C	The other half, I'm only tryin' to
TSW:12:029:C	Let you know that what I feel is true
TSW:12:030:C	And I'm only me when I'm with you
TSW:12:031:B	When I'm with anybody else
TSW:12:032:B	It's so hard to be myself
TSW:12:033:B	And only you can tell
TSW:12:034:C	That I'm only up when you're not down
TSW:12:035:C	Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
TSW:12:036:C	It's like no matter what I do
TSW:12:037:C	Well, you drive me crazy half the time
TSW:12:038:C	The other half, I'm only tryin' to
TSW:12:039:C	Let you know that what I feel is true
TSW:12:040:C	And I'm only me
TSW:12:041:C	Who I wanna be
TSW:12:042:C	Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
TSW:12:043:I	With you
TSW:12:044:I	Uh-huh-huh, yeah
TSW:13:001:V	She can't see the way your eyes
TSW:13:002:V	Light up when you smile
TSW:13:003:V	She'll never notice how you stop and stare
TSW:13:004:V	Whenever she walks by
TSW:13:005:C	And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
TSW:13:006:C	But you are everything to me
TSW:13:007:C	And I just wanna show you
TSW:13:008:C	She don't even know you
TSW:13:009:C	She's never gonna love you like I want to
TSW:13:010:C	And you just see right through me
TSW:13:011:C	But if you only knew me
TSW:13:012:C	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
TSW:13:013:C	Instead of just invisible
TSW:13:014:C	Oh, yeah, oh
TSW:13:015:V	There's a fire inside of you
TSW:13:016:V	That can't help but shine through
TSW:13:017:V	She's never gonna see the light
TSW:13:018:V	No matter what you do
TSW:13:019:C	And all I think about is how to make you think of me
TSW:13:020:C	And everything that we could be
TSW:13:021:C	And I just wanna show you
TSW:13:022:C	She don't even know you
TSW:13:023:C	She's never gonna love you like I want to
TSW:13:024:C	And you just see right through me
TSW:13:025:C	But if you only knew me
TSW:13:026:C	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
TSW:13:027:C	Instead of just invisible
TSW:13:028:B	Like shadows in a faded light
TSW:13:029:B	Oh, we're invisible
TSW:13:030:B	I just wanna open your eyes
TSW:13:031:B	And make you realize
TSW:13:032:C	I just wanna show you
TSW:13:033:C	She don't even know you
TSW:13:034:C	Baby, let me love you, let me want you
TSW:13:035:C	You just see right through me
TSW:13:036:C	But if you only knew me
TSW:13:037:C	We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
TSW:13:038:C	Instead of just invisible
TSW:13:039:C	Oh, yeah
TSW:13:040:I	She can't see the way your eyes
TSW:13:041:I	Light up when you smile
TSW:14:001:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:002:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:003:C	Why would you wanna take
TSW:14:004:C	Our love and tear it all apart now?
TSW:14:005:C	Why would you wanna make
TSW:14:006:C	The very first scar?
TSW:14:007:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:008:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:009:V	Maybe I should've seen the signs
TSW:14:010:V	Should've read the writing on the wall
TSW:14:011:V	And realized by the distance in your eyes
TSW:14:012:V	That I would be the one to fall
TSW:14:013:C	No matter what you say
TSW:14:014:C	I still can't believe that you would walk away
TSW:14:015:C	It don't make sense to me, but
TSW:14:016:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:017:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:018:C	Why would you wanna take
TSW:14:019:C	Our love and tear it all apart now?
TSW:14:020:C	Why would you wanna make
TSW:14:021:C	The very first scar?
TSW:14:022:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:023:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:024:B	It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
TSW:14:025:B	How do I get it back the way it was before?
TSW:14:026:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:027:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:028:C	Why would you wanna take
TSW:14:029:C	Our love and tear it all apart now?
TSW:14:030:C	Why would you wanna make
TSW:14:031:C	The very first scar?
TSW:14:032:C	Why would you wanna break—
TSW:14:033:C	(Why) Would you wanna break it?
TSW:14:034:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:035:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:036:C	Why would you wanna take
TSW:14:037:C	Our love and tear it all apart now?
TSW:14:038:C	Why would you wanna make
TSW:14:039:C	The very first scar?
TSW:14:040:C	Why would you wanna break
TSW:14:041:C	A perfectly good heart?
TSW:14:042:C	Mmm-hmm
FER:01:001:V	There's somethin' 'bout the way
FER:01:002:V	The street looks when it's just rained
FER:01:003:V	There's a glow off the pavement
FER:01:004:V	You walk me to the car
FER:01:005:V	And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
FER:01:006:V	In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
FER:01:007:V	Oh, yeah
FER:01:008:V	We're driving down the road
FER:01:009:V	I wonder if you know
FER:01:010:V	I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
FER:01:011:V	But you're just so cool
FER:01:012:V	Run your hands through your hair
FER:01:013:V	Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
FER:01:014:C	And I don't know how it gets better than this
FER:01:015:C	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
FER:01:016:C	And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
FER:01:017:C	In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
FER:01:018:V	So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
FER:01:019:V	In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here
FER:01:020:V	In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
FER:01:021:V	In this moment now, capture it, remember it
FER:01:022:C	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
FER:01:023:C	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
FER:01:024:C	And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
FER:01:025:C	In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
FER:01:026:C	Oh-oh
FER:01:027:B	Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
FER:01:028:B	My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
FER:01:029:B	But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
FER:01:030:B	It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
FER:01:031:B	It's fearless
FER:01:032:B	Oh, yeah
FER:01:033:C	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
FER:01:034:C	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
FER:01:035:C	And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
FER:01:036:C	In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
FER:01:037:C	'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
FER:01:038:C	You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
FER:01:039:C	And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
FER:01:040:C	In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
FER:01:041:I	Oh-oh
FER:01:042:I	Oh-oh, yeah
FER:02:001:V	You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
FER:02:002:V	It's the mornin' of your very first day
FER:02:003:V	You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
FER:02:004:V	Try and stay out of everybody's way
FER:02:005:V	It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
FER:02:006:V	For the next four years in this town
FER:02:007:V	Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
FER:02:008:V	"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
FER:02:009:C	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
FER:02:010:C	You're gonna believe them
FER:02:011:C	And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
FER:02:012:C	Well, count to ten, take it in
FER:02:013:C	This is life before you know who you're gonna be
FER:02:014:C	At fifteen
FER:02:015:V	You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
FER:02:016:V	And soon enough, you're best friends
FER:02:017:V	Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
FER:02:018:V	We'll be outta here as soon as we can
FER:02:019:V	And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
FER:02:020:V	And you're feelin' like flyin'
FER:02:021:V	And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
FER:02:022:V	And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
FER:02:023:V	When the night ends
FER:02:024:C	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
FER:02:025:C	You're gonna believe them
FER:02:026:C	And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
FER:02:027:C	Makes your head spin around, well
FER:02:028:C	In your life you'll do things greater than
FER:02:029:C	Datin' the boy on the football team
FER:02:030:C	I didn't know it at fifteen
FER:02:031:B	When all you wanted was to be wanted
FER:02:032:B	Wish you could go back
FER:02:033:B	And tell yourself what you know now
FER:02:034:V	Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
FER:02:035:V	But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
FER:02:036:V	And Abigail gave everything she had
FER:02:037:V	To a boy who changed his mind
FER:02:038:V	And we both cried
FER:02:039:C	'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
FER:02:040:C	You're gonna believe them
FER:02:041:C	And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
FER:02:042:C	But I've found time can heal most anything
FER:02:043:C	And you just might find who you're supposed to be
FER:02:044:C	I didn't know who I was supposed to be
FER:02:045:C	At fifteen
FER:02:046:C	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
FER:02:047:C	La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
FER:02:048:C	La-la-la, la-la-la
FER:02:049:I	Your very first day
FER:02:050:I	Take a deep breath, girl
FER:02:051:I	Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
FER:03:001:V	We were both young when I first saw you
FER:03:002:V	I close my eyes and the flashback starts
FER:03:003:V	I'm standing there
FER:03:004:V	On a balcony in summer air
FER:03:005:V	See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
FER:03:006:V	See you make your way through the crowd
FER:03:007:V	And say, "Hello"
FER:03:008:V	Little did I know
FER:03:009:C	That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
FER:03:010:C	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
FER:03:011:C	And I was crying on the staircase
FER:03:012:C	Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
FER:03:013:C	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
FER:03:014:C	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
FER:03:015:C	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
FER:03:016:C	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
FER:03:017:V	So I sneak out to the garden to see you
FER:03:018:V	We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
FER:03:019:V	So close your eyes
FER:03:020:V	Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
FER:03:021:C	'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
FER:03:022:C	And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
FER:03:023:C	But you were everything to me
FER:03:024:C	I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
FER:03:025:C	Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
FER:03:026:C	I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
FER:03:027:C	You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
FER:03:028:C	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
FER:03:029:C	Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
FER:03:030:C	This love is difficult, but it's real
FER:03:031:C	Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
FER:03:032:C	It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
FER:03:033:C	Oh, oh
FER:03:034:B	But I got tired of waiting
FER:03:035:B	Wondering if you were ever coming around
FER:03:036:B	My faith in you was fading
FER:03:037:B	When I met you on the outskirts of town
FER:03:038:C	And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
FER:03:039:C	I keep waiting for you, but you never come
FER:03:040:C	Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
FER:03:041:C	He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
FER:03:042:C	"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
FER:03:043:C	I love you and that's all I really know
FER:03:044:C	I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
FER:03:045:C	It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"
FER:03:046:I	Oh, oh, oh
FER:03:047:I	Oh, oh, oh
FER:03:048:I	'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
FER:04:001:I	Mmm, mmm
FER:04:002:I	Mmm, mmm
FER:04:003:I	Mmm, yeah
FER:04:004:V	Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
FER:04:005:V	But I know I saw a light in you
FER:04:006:V	And as we walked, we were talkin'
FER:04:007:V	I didn't say half the things I wanted to
FER:04:008:V	Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
FER:04:009:V	I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
FER:04:010:V	Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
FER:04:011:V	I don't always have to be alone
FER:04:012:C	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
FER:04:013:C	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
FER:04:014:C	Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
FER:04:015:C	Can't help it if there's no one else
FER:04:016:C	Mmm, I can't help myself
FER:04:017:C	Mm, mmm
FER:04:018:C	Oh-woah, mmm
FER:04:019:V	Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
FER:04:020:V	So I've got some things to say to you, huh
FER:04:021:V	I've seen it all, so I thought
FER:04:022:V	But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
FER:04:023:V	The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
FER:04:024:V	It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
FER:04:025:V	Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
FER:04:026:V	I think you and I should stay the same
FER:04:027:C	'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
FER:04:028:C	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
FER:04:029:C	Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
FER:04:030:C	Can't help it if there's no one else
FER:04:031:C	Mmm, I can't help myself
FER:04:032:C	Mmm, mmm
FER:04:033:B	They're dimming the street lights
FER:04:034:B	You're perfect for me
FER:04:035:B	Why aren't you here tonight?
FER:04:036:B	I'm waitin' alone now
FER:04:037:B	So come on and come out
FER:04:038:B	And pull me near
FER:04:039:B	And shine, shine, shine
FER:04:040:V	Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
FER:04:041:V	Why I should be the one you choose
FER:04:042:V	All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
FER:04:043:V	But would they write a song for you? ha-ha
FER:04:044:C	I can't help it if you look like an angel
FER:04:045:C	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
FER:04:046:C	Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
FER:04:047:C	Can't help it if there's no one else
FER:04:048:C	Mmm, I can't help myself
FER:04:049:C	If you look like an angel
FER:04:050:C	Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
FER:04:051:C	Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
FER:04:052:C	Can't help it if there's no one else
FER:04:053:C	Mmm, I can't help myself
FER:04:054:I	Oh-oh, myself
FER:04:055:I	Mmm, I can't help myself
FER:04:056:I	I can't help myself, oh-oh-oh
FER:04:057:I	Mmm, mmm
FER:04:058:I	Mmm, mmm, mmm
FER:05:001:V	Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
FER:05:002:V	Comes out just when you need it to
FER:05:003:V	As I paced back and forth all this time
FER:05:004:V	'Cause I honestly believed in you
FER:05:005:C	Holdin' on, the days drag on
FER:05:006:C	Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
FER:05:007:C	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
FER:05:008:C	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
FER:05:009:C	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
FER:05:010:C	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
FER:05:011:C	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
FER:05:012:C	To come around
FER:05:013:V	Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
FER:05:014:V	And never really had a chance
FER:05:015:V	Well, my mistake, I didn't know to be in love
FER:05:016:V	You had to fight to have the upper hand
FER:05:017:C	I had so many dreams about you and me
FER:05:018:C	Happy endings, well now I know
FER:05:019:C	That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
FER:05:020:C	I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
FER:05:021:C	This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
FER:05:022:C	I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
FER:05:023:C	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
FER:05:024:C	To come around
FER:05:025:B	And there you are on your knees
FER:05:026:B	Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
FER:05:027:B	Just like I always wanted
FER:05:028:B	But I'm so sorry
FER:05:029:C	'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
FER:05:030:C	I'm gonna find someone someday
FER:05:031:C	Who might actually treat me well
FER:05:032:C	This is a big world, that was a small town
FER:05:033:C	There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
FER:05:034:C	And it's too late for you and your white horse
FER:05:035:C	Now it's too late for you and your white horse
FER:05:036:C	To catch me now
FER:05:037:I	Oh, woah, woah, woah
FER:05:038:I	Try and catch me now, oh
FER:05:039:I	It's too late to catch me now
FER:06:001:V	You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
FER:06:002:V	She's goin' off about something that you said
FER:06:003:V	'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
FER:06:004:V	I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
FER:06:005:V	I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
FER:06:006:V	And she'll never know your story like I do
FER:06:007:C	'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
FER:06:008:C	She's cheer-captain and I'm on the bleachers
FER:06:009:C	Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
FER:06:010:C	That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
FER:06:011:C	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
FER:06:012:C	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
FER:06:013:C	You belong with me, you belong with me
FER:06:014:V	Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
FER:06:015:V	I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
FER:06:016:V	Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
FER:06:017:V	"Hey, isn't this easy?"
FER:06:018:V	And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
FER:06:019:V	I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
FER:06:020:V	You say you're fine, I know you better than that
FER:06:021:V	Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?
FER:06:022:C	She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
FER:06:023:C	She's cheer-captain and I'm on the bleachers
FER:06:024:C	Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
FER:06:025:C	That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
FER:06:026:C	If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
FER:06:027:C	Been here all along, so why can't you see?
FER:06:028:C	You belong with me
FER:06:029:C	Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
FER:06:030:C	All this time, how could you not know, baby?
FER:06:031:C	You belong with me, you belong with me
FER:06:032:B	Oh, I remember you
FER:06:033:B	Driving to my house in the middle of the night
FER:06:034:B	I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
FER:06:035:B	I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
FER:06:036:B	Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me
FER:06:037:C	Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
FER:06:038:C	Been here all along, so why can't you see? (Ah)
FER:06:039:C	You belong with me
FER:06:040:C	Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
FER:06:041:C	All this time, how could you not know, baby?
FER:06:042:C	You belong with me, you belong with me
FER:06:043:I	You belong with me
FER:06:044:I	Have you ever thought, just maybe you belong with me?
FER:06:045:I	You belong with me
FER:07:001:V	I see your face in my mind as I drive away
FER:07:002:V	'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
FER:07:003:V	People are people and sometimes we change our minds
FER:07:004:V	But it's killin' me to see you go after all this time
FER:07:005:B	Mm, mmm
FER:07:006:B	Mm, mmm
FER:07:007:V	The music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
FER:07:008:V	It's the kind of endin' you don't really wanna see
FER:07:009:V	'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
FER:07:010:V	Now I don't know what to be without you around
FER:07:011:C	And we know it's never simple, never easy
FER:07:012:C	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
FER:07:013:C	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
FER:07:014:C	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:015:C	Breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:016:V	Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
FER:07:017:V	Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
FER:07:018:V	But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
FER:07:019:V	And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout
FER:07:020:C	And we know it's never simple, never easy
FER:07:021:C	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
FER:07:022:C	You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
FER:07:023:C	And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:024:C	Breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:025:B	It's 2AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend
FER:07:026:B	Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
FER:07:027:B	It's 2AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend
FER:07:028:B	Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
FER:07:029:C	And we know it's never simple, never easy
FER:07:030:C	Never a clean break, no one here to save me
FER:07:031:C	Woah
FER:07:032:C	I can't breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:033:C	Breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:034:C	Breathe without you, but I have to
FER:07:035:I	I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm), I'm sorry (Yeah, yeah), I'm sorry
FER:07:036:I	I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh), I'm sorry
FER:08:001:V	I took a chance, I took a shot
FER:08:002:V	And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
FER:08:003:V	You took a swing, I took it hard
FER:08:004:V	And down here from the ground, I see who you are
FER:08:005:C	I'm sick and tired of your attitude
FER:08:006:C	I'm feelin' like I don't know you
FER:08:007:C	You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
FER:08:008:C	And I need you like a heartbeat
FER:08:009:C	But you know you got a mean streak
FER:08:010:C	Makes me run for cover when you're around
FER:08:011:C	Here's to you and your temper
FER:08:012:C	Yes, I remember what you said last night
FER:08:013:C	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
FER:08:014:C	Tell me why
FER:08:015:V	Well, you could write a book on
FER:08:016:V	How to ruin someone's perfect day
FER:08:017:V	Well, I get so confused and frustrated
FER:08:018:V	Forget what I'm trying to say, oh-oh
FER:08:019:C	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
FER:08:020:C	I got no one to believe in
FER:08:021:C	You tell me that you want me, then push me around
FER:08:022:C	And I need you like a heartbeat
FER:08:023:C	But you know you got a mean streak
FER:08:024:C	Makes me run for cover when you're around
FER:08:025:C	Here's to you and your temper
FER:08:026:C	Yes, I remember what you said last night
FER:08:027:C	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
FER:08:028:C	Tell me why
FER:08:029:B	Why do you have to make me feel small
FER:08:030:B	So you can feel whole inside?
FER:08:031:B	Why do you have to put down my dreams
FER:08:032:B	So you're the only thing on my mind?
FER:08:033:C	Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
FER:08:034:C	Feelin' like I don't know you
FER:08:035:C	You tell me that you want me and cut me down
FER:08:036:C	I'm sick and tired of your reasons
FER:08:037:C	I've got no one to believe in
FER:08:038:C	You ask me for my love, then you push me around
FER:08:039:C	Here's to you and your temper
FER:08:040:C	Yes, I remember what you said last night
FER:08:041:C	And I know that you see what you're doing to me
FER:08:042:C	Tell me why
FER:08:043:C	Why
FER:08:044:C	Tell me why, oh
FER:08:045:I	I take a step back, I let you go
FER:08:046:I	I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
FER:09:001:V	All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around
FER:09:002:V	I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
FER:09:003:V	And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
FER:09:004:V	And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around
FER:09:005:C	You don't have to call anymore
FER:09:006:C	I won't pick up the phone
FER:09:007:C	This is the last straw
FER:09:008:C	Don't wanna hurt anymore
FER:09:009:C	And you can tell me that you're sorry
FER:09:010:C	But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
FER:09:011:C	You're not sorry
FER:09:012:C	No, no, no, no
FER:09:013:V	You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
FER:09:014:V	Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold
FER:09:015:V	And you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
FER:09:016:V	And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
FER:09:017:C	But you don't have to call anymore
FER:09:018:C	I won't pick up the phone

FER:09:029:C	So you don't have to call anymore
FER:09:030:C	I won't pick up the phone
FER:09:031:C	This is the last straw
FER:09:032:C	There's nothin' left to beg for
FER:09:033:C	And you can tell me that you're sorry

FER:10:001:V	He is sensible and so incredible
FER:10:002:V	And all my single friends are jealous
FER:10:003:V	He says everything I need to hear
FER:10:004:V	And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
FER:10:005:C	He opens up my door and I get into his car
FER:10:006:C	And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
FER:10:007:C	And I feel perfectly fine
FER:10:008:C	But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
FER:10:009:C	And it's 2AM and I'm cursin' your name
FER:10:010:C	So in love that you act insane
FER:10:011:C	And that's the way I loved you
FER:10:012:C	Breakin' down and comin' undone
FER:10:013:C	It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
FER:10:014:C	And I never knew I could feel that much

FER:10:016:V	He respects my space
FER:10:017:V	And never makes me wait
FER:10:018:V	And he calls exactly when he says he will
FER:10:019:V	He's close to my mother
FER:10:020:V	Talks business with my father
FER:10:021:V	He's charming and endearing
FER:10:022:V	And I'm comfortable
FER:10:023:C	But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

FER:10:033:B	'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all
FER:10:034:B	And you were wild and crazy
FER:10:035:B	Just so frustrating, intoxicatin', complicated
FER:10:036:B	Got away by some mistake and now
FER:10:037:C	I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

FER:11:001:V	Once upon a time
FER:11:002:V	I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
FER:11:003:V	And we caught onto somethin'
FER:11:004:V	I hold onto the night
FER:11:005:V	You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
FER:11:006:V	Were you just kiddin'?
FER:11:007:V	'Cause it seems to me
FER:11:008:V	This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
FER:11:009:V	I don't feel welcome anymore
FER:11:010:V	Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
FER:11:011:V	'Cause, one second, it was perfect
FER:11:012:V	Now you're halfway out the door
FER:11:013:C	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
FER:11:014:C	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
FER:11:015:C	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
FER:11:016:C	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
FER:11:017:C	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
FER:11:018:C	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
FER:11:019:V	Was I out of line?
FER:11:020:V	Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
FER:11:021:V	Like a scared little boy?
FER:11:022:V	I looked into your eyes
FER:11:023:V	Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
FER:11:024:V	So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
FER:11:025:V	Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
FER:11:026:V	Where is this going?
FER:11:027:V	Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
FER:11:028:C	And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
FER:11:029:C	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
FER:11:030:C	And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
FER:11:031:C	Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
FER:11:032:C	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
FER:11:033:C	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
FER:11:034:C	You didn't mean it, baby
FER:11:035:C	I don't think so
FER:11:036:C	Oh, woah
FER:11:037:B	Oh, back up, baby, back up
FER:11:038:B	Did you forget everything?
FER:11:039:B	Back up, baby, back up
FER:11:040:B	Did you forget everything?
FER:11:041:C	'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
FER:11:042:C	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
FER:11:043:C	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
FER:11:044:C	Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
FER:11:045:C	And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
FER:11:046:C	And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
FER:11:047:C	And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
FER:11:048:C	It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
FER:11:049:C	'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
FER:11:050:I	You didn't mean it, baby
FER:11:051:I	You said, "Forever and always," yeah
FER:12:001:V	I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on
FER:12:002:V	I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run
FER:12:003:V	Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold
FER:12:004:V	I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
FER:12:005:C	I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
FER:12:006:C	But I know you're not scared of anything at all
FER:12:007:C	Don't know if Snow-White's house is near or far away
FER:12:008:C	But I know I had the best day with you today
FER:12:009:V	I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
FER:12:010:V	I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys
FER:12:011:V	And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
FER:12:012:V	And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
FER:12:013:C	I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
FER:12:014:C	But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you
FER:12:015:C	Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
FER:12:016:C	But I know I had the best day with you today
FER:12:017:B	I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
FER:12:018:B	god smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
FER:12:019:B	I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
FER:12:020:B	And I had the best days with you
FER:12:021:V	There is a video I found from back when I was three
FER:12:022:V	You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me
FER:12:023:V	It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
FER:12:024:V	Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
FER:12:025:C	Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
FER:12:026:C	I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
FER:12:027:C	And I love you for givin' me your eyes
FER:12:028:C	For staying back and watchin' me shine
FER:12:029:C	And I didn't know if you knew
FER:12:030:C	So I'm taking this chance to say
FER:12:031:C	That I had the best day with you today
FER:13:001:V	Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits ya
FER:13:002:V	Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
FER:13:003:V	You know it's all the same, another time and place
FER:13:004:V	Repeatin' history and you're gettin' sick of it
FER:13:005:C	But I believe in whatever you do
FER:13:006:C	And I'll do anything to see it through
FER:13:007:C	Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
FER:13:008:C	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
FER:13:009:C	This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
FER:13:010:C	And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
FER:13:011:C	Oh, oh
FER:13:012:V	So we've been outnumbered, raided and, now, cornered
FER:13:013:V	It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
FER:13:014:V	We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
FER:13:015:V	They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
FER:13:016:C	You can walk away, say, "We don't need this"
FER:13:017:C	But there's somethin' in your eyes, says, "We can beat this"
FER:13:018:C	'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
FER:13:019:C	These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
FER:13:020:C	This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
FER:13:021:C	And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
FER:13:022:C	Oh, oh-woah
FER:13:023:B	Tonight, we'll stand and get off our knees
FER:13:024:B	Fight for what we've worked for all these years
FER:13:025:B	And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
FER:13:026:B	But we'll stand up champions tonight
FER:13:027:C	It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
FER:13:028:C	When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
FER:13:029:C	It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
FER:13:030:C	And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh
FER:13:031:I	Hallelujah
FER:14:001:V	I like the way you sound in the mornin'
FER:14:002:V	We're on the phone and without a warnin'
FER:14:003:V	I realize your laugh is the best sound
FER:14:004:V	I have ever heard
FER:14:005:V	I like the way I can't keep my focus
FER:14:006:V	I watch you talk, you didn't notice
FER:14:007:V	I hear the words, but all I can think is
FER:14:008:V	"We should be together"
FER:14:009:C	Every time you smile, I smile
FER:14:010:C	And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
FER:14:011:C	Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
FER:14:012:C	Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
FER:14:013:C	Jump, then fall into me

FER:14:016:C	'Cause I'ma stay through it all
FER:14:017:C	So, jump, then fall
FER:14:018:V	Huh, well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
FER:14:019:V	You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
FER:14:020:V	I've never been so wrapped up, honey
FER:14:021:V	I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
FER:14:022:V	I had time to think it oh-over
FER:14:023:V	And all I can say is, "Come closer"
FER:14:024:V	Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me
FER:14:025:C	'Cause every time you smile, I smile
FER:14:026:C	And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
FER:14:027:C	Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby

FER:14:032:C	'Cause I'ma stay through it all
FER:14:033:C	So, jump, then fall
FER:14:034:B	The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
FER:14:035:B	I'll catch you, I'll catch you
FER:14:036:B	When people say things that bring you to your knees
FER:14:037:B	I'll catch you
FER:14:038:B	The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
FER:14:039:B	But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

FER:14:054:I	Jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah
FER:15:001:V	Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
FER:15:002:V	I'm reachin' out and I just can't tell you why
FER:15:003:V	I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
FER:15:004:C	Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
FER:15:005:C	And when you're close, I feel like comin' undone
FER:15:006:C	In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
FER:15:007:C	It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
FER:15:008:C	You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
FER:15:009:C	Come on, come on, little taste of Heaven

FER:15:012:V	I know you're sayin' that you'd be here anyway
FER:15:013:C	But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
FER:15:014:C	And now that you're close, I feel like comin' undone

FER:17:002:V	But I don't wanna go there anymore
FER:17:003:V	And I know all the steps up to your door
FER:17:004:V	But I don't wanna go there anymore
FER:17:005:C	Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
FER:17:006:C	Talk to the man with the reasons why
FER:17:007:C	And let me know what you find
FER:17:008:C	I'll leave my window open
FER:17:009:C	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
FER:17:010:C	Just know, I'm right here hopin'
FER:17:011:C	That you'll come in with the rain
FER:17:012:V	I could stand up and sing you a song
FER:17:013:V	But I don't wanna have to go that far
FER:17:014:V	And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
FER:17:015:V	And you don't even know where I start
FER:17:016:C	Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
FER:17:017:C	Talk to the man who put you here
FER:17:018:C	And don't wait for the sky to clear
FER:17:019:C	I'll leave my window open
FER:17:020:C	'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
FER:17:021:C	Just know, I'm right here hopin'
FER:17:022:C	That you'll come in with the rain
FER:17:023:B	I've watched you so long
FER:17:024:B	Screamed your name
FER:17:025:B	I don't know what else I can say
FER:17:026:C	I'll leave my window open
FER:17:027:C	'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
FER:17:028:C	Just know, I'm right here hopin'
FER:17:029:C	That you'll come in with the rain
FER:17:030:I	I could go back to every laugh
FER:17:031:I	But I don't wanna go there anymore
FER:18:001:V	This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like
FER:18:002:V	There ain't nothin' more right, babe
FER:18:003:V	Misty mornin' comes again and I can't
FER:18:004:V	Help but wish I could see your face
FER:18:005:V	I knew from the first note played
FER:18:006:V	I'd be breakin' all my rules to see you
FER:18:007:C	You smile that beautiful smile
FER:18:008:C	And all the girls in the front row
FER:18:009:C	Scream your name
FER:18:010:C	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
FER:18:011:C	"I can't keep my eyes off of you"
FER:18:012:C	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
FER:18:013:C	Who's desperately in love with you
FER:18:014:C	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
FER:18:015:C	Superstar
FER:18:016:V	Mornin' loneliness comes around when I'm not
FER:18:017:V	Dreamin' about you
FER:18:018:V	When my world wakes up today
FER:18:019:V	You'll be in another town
FER:18:020:V	And I knew when I saw your face
FER:18:021:V	I'd be counting down the ways to see you
FER:18:022:C	You smile that beautiful smile
FER:18:023:C	And all the girls in the front row
FER:18:024:C	Scream your name
FER:18:025:C	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
FER:18:026:C	"I can't take my eyes off of you"
FER:18:027:C	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
FER:18:028:C	Who's desperately in love with you
FER:18:029:C	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
FER:18:030:C	Superstar
FER:18:031:B	You played in bars, you play guitar
FER:18:032:B	I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
FER:18:033:B	And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
FER:18:034:B	Every night from the radio
FER:18:035:C	So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
FER:18:036:C	"I can't take my eyes off of you"
FER:18:037:C	I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
FER:18:038:C	Who's desperately in love with you
FER:18:039:C	Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
FER:18:040:C	Superstar
FER:18:041:I	Sweet, sweet superstar
FER:18:042:I	Superstar
FER:19:001:V	In the heat of the fight, I walked away
FER:19:002:V	Ignorin' words that you were sayin', tryna make me stay
FER:19:003:V	I said, "This time I've had enough"
FER:19:004:V	And you've called a hundred times
FER:19:005:V	But I'm not pickin' up
FER:19:006:C	'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
FER:19:007:C	But if you look a little closer
FER:19:008:C	I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
FER:19:009:C	To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles
FER:19:010:C	Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
FER:19:011:C	Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
FER:19:012:C	And don't you leave 'cause I know
FER:19:013:C	All I need is on the other side of the door
FER:19:014:V	Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
FER:19:015:V	Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
FER:19:016:V	I keep goin' back over things we both said
FER:19:017:V	And I remember the slammin' door
FER:19:018:V	And all the things that I misread
FER:19:019:C	Oh, babe, if you know everything
FER:19:020:C	Tell me why you couldn't see
FER:19:021:C	When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
FER:19:022:C	I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
FER:19:023:C	To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
FER:19:024:C	Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
FER:19:025:C	Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
FER:19:026:C	And don't you leave 'cause I know
FER:19:027:C	All I need is on the other side of the door
FER:19:028:B	And I'll scream out the window
FER:19:029:B	"I can't even look at you"
FER:19:030:B	I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
FER:19:031:B	I say, "There's nothin' you can say
FER:19:032:B	To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
FER:19:033:B	But what I mean is
FER:19:034:C	I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
FER:19:035:C	To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
FER:19:036:C	Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
FER:19:037:C	Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
FER:19:038:C	And don't you leave 'cause I know
FER:19:039:C	All I need is on the other side of the door
FER:19:040:I	With your face and the beautiful eyes
FER:19:041:I	And the conversation with the little white lies
FER:19:042:I	And the faded picture of a beautiful night
FER:19:043:I	You carried me from your car up the stairs
FER:19:044:I	And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
FER:19:045:I	After everything and that little black dress
FER:19:046:I	After everything, I must confess
FER:19:047:I	I need you
FER:20:001:V	Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
FER:20:002:V	I used to be a damsel in distress
FER:20:003:V	You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
FER:20:004:V	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:005:V	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:006:V	Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
FER:20:007:V	You wore a dark gray T-shirt
FER:20:008:V	You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
FER:20:009:V	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:010:C	Time slows down
FER:20:011:C	Whenever you're around
FER:20:012:C	Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
FER:20:013:C	It must have been the way you kissed me
FER:20:014:C	Fell in love when I saw you standing there
FER:20:015:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:016:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:017:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:018:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:019:V	Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
FER:20:020:V	That takes me to another planet
FER:20:021:V	Every move you make, everything you say is right
FER:20:022:V	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:023:V	Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
FER:20:024:V	Is, now it's gettin' so much clearer
FER:20:025:V	Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
FER:20:026:V	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:027:C	Time slows down
FER:20:028:C	Whenever you're around, yeah
FER:20:029:C	But can you feel this magic in the air?
FER:20:030:C	It must have been the way you kissed me
FER:20:031:C	Fell in love when I saw you standing there
FER:20:032:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:033:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:034:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:035:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:036:B	Time slows down
FER:20:037:B	Whenever you're around
FER:20:038:B	I can feel my heart
FER:20:039:B	It's beating in my chest
FER:20:040:B	Did you feel it?
FER:20:041:B	I can't put this down
FER:20:042:C	But can you feel this magic in the air?
FER:20:043:C	It must have been the way you kissed me
FER:20:044:C	Fell in love when I saw you standing there
FER:20:045:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:046:C	But can you feel this magic in the air?
FER:20:047:C	It must have been the way you kissed me
FER:20:048:C	Fell in love when I saw you standing there
FER:20:049:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:050:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:051:C	It must have been the way
FER:20:052:C	Today was a fairytale
FER:20:053:I	Oh, oh, yeah, woah
FER:20:054:I	Today was a fairytale
FER:21:001:V	Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
FER:21:002:V	Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
FER:21:003:V	The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
FER:21:004:V	They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
FER:21:005:V	You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
FER:21:006:V	You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
FER:21:007:V	But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
FER:21:008:V	You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me
FER:21:009:C	I lived and I learned
FER:21:010:C	Had you, got burned
FER:21:011:C	Held out and held on
FER:21:012:C	god knows, too long, and wasted time
FER:21:013:C	Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
FER:21:014:C	But no amount of freedom gets you clean
FER:21:015:C	I've still got you all over me
FER:21:016:V	The best and worst day of June
FER:21:017:V	Was the one that I met you
FER:21:018:V	With your hands in your pockets
FER:21:019:V	And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
FER:21:020:V	Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
FER:21:021:V	Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
FER:21:022:C	And I lived and I learned
FER:21:023:C	Had you, got burned
FER:21:024:C	Held out and held on
FER:21:025:C	god knows, too long, and wasted time
FER:21:026:C	Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
FER:21:027:C	But no amount of freedom gets you clean
FER:21:028:C	I've still got you all over me
FER:21:029:C	I lived and I learned
FER:21:030:C	And found out what it was to turn around
FER:21:031:C	And see that we
FER:21:032:C	Were never really meant to be
FER:21:033:C	So I lied, and I cried
FER:21:034:C	And I watched a part of myself die
FER:21:035:C	'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
FER:21:036:C	I've still got you all over me
FER:21:037:I	I've still got you all over me
FER:21:038:I	Still got you all over me
FER:22:001:V	Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
FER:22:002:V	Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
FER:22:003:V	Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
FER:22:004:V	Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
FER:22:005:C	But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
FER:22:006:C	Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
FER:22:007:C	It takes everything in me just to get up each day
FER:22:008:C	But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
FER:22:009:C	Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:010:C	How's your heart after breakin' mine?
FER:22:011:C	Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
FER:22:012:C	Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
FER:22:013:C	Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
FER:22:014:C	I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
FER:22:015:C	And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:016:V	Mr. "Never told me why," Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
FER:22:017:V	Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
FER:22:018:V	He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
FER:22:019:V	Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same
FER:22:020:C	Because I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
FER:22:021:C	I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
FER:22:022:C	And I never got past what you put me through
FER:22:023:C	But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you
FER:22:024:C	Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:025:C	How's your heart after breakin' mine?
FER:22:026:C	Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
FER:22:027:C	Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
FER:22:028:C	Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
FER:22:029:C	I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
FER:22:030:C	And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:031:B	So dignified in your well-pressed suit
FER:22:032:B	So strategized, all the eyes on you
FER:22:033:B	Sashay your way to your seat
FER:22:034:B	It's the best seat in the best room
FER:22:035:B	Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
FER:22:036:B	So far above me in every sense
FER:22:037:B	So far above feelin' anything
FER:22:038:B	And it's really such a shame
FER:22:039:B	It's such a shame
FER:22:040:B	'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
FER:22:041:B	Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
FER:22:042:B	And someday, maybe you'll miss me
FER:22:043:B	But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"
FER:22:044:C	Goodbye, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:045:C	How's your heart after breakin' mine?
FER:22:046:C	Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
FER:22:047:C	Goodbye, Mr. "Casually cruel"
FER:22:048:C	Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
FER:22:049:C	I've been Miss Misery for the last time
FER:22:050:C	And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
FER:22:051:I	You're perfectly fine
FER:22:052:I	Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
FER:22:053:I	You said you'd never go away
FER:23:001:V	We used to walk along the streets
FER:23:002:V	When the porch lights were shinin' bright
FER:23:003:V	Before I had somewhere to be
FER:23:004:V	Back when we had all night
FER:23:005:V	And we were happy
FER:23:006:V	I do recall a good while back
FER:23:007:V	We snuck into the circus
FER:23:008:V	You threw your arms around my neck
FER:23:009:V	Back when I deserved it
FER:23:010:V	And we were happy
FER:23:011:C	When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
FER:23:012:C	We showed 'em all up
FER:23:013:C	No one could touch the way we
FER:23:014:C	Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
FER:23:015:C	We were gonna buy someday
FER:23:016:C	And we were happy
FER:23:017:V	We used to watch the Sun go down
FER:23:018:V	On the boats in the water
FER:23:019:V	That's sorta how I feel right now
FER:23:020:V	And goodbye's so much harder
FER:23:021:V	'Cause we were happy
FER:23:022:C	When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
FER:23:023:C	We showed 'em all up
FER:23:024:C	No one could touch the way we
FER:23:025:C	Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
FER:23:026:C	We were gonna buy someday
FER:23:027:C	And we were happy
FER:23:028:C	We were happy
FER:23:029:B	Oh, I hate those voices
FER:23:030:B	Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
FER:23:031:B	But they don't give me choices
FER:23:032:B	And that's what these tears are for
FER:23:033:C	'Cause we were happy
FER:23:034:C	We were happy
FER:23:035:C	When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
FER:23:036:C	We showed 'em all up
FER:23:037:C	No one could touch the way we
FER:23:038:C	Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
FER:23:039:C	And you were gonna marry me
FER:23:040:C	And we were happy
FER:23:041:I	We were happy
FER:23:042:I	Oh, we were happy
FER:24:001:V	You said, "I know"
FER:24:002:V	When I said, "I need some time, need some space
FER:24:003:V	To think about all of this"
FER:24:004:V	And you watched me go
FER:24:005:V	And I knew my words were hard to hear
FER:24:006:V	And harder to ever take back
FER:24:007:C	And I said, "When can I come back?"
FER:24:008:C	And you said, "That's when
FER:24:009:C	When I wake up in the morning
FER:24:010:C	That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
FER:24:011:C	Laughin', when I'm cryin'
FER:24:012:C	And that's when
FER:24:013:C	I'll be waitin' at the front gate
FER:24:014:C	That's when, when I see your face
FER:24:015:C	I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"
FER:24:016:C	Mmm, mm
FER:24:017:V	I said, "I know"
FER:24:018:V	When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
FER:24:019:V	And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
FER:24:020:V	Then through the phone
FER:24:021:V	Came all your tears
FER:24:022:V	And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
FER:24:023:C	And you said, "When can I come back?"
FER:24:024:C	And I said, "That's when
FER:24:025:C	When I wake up in the morning
FER:24:026:C	That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
FER:24:027:C	Laughin', when I'm cryin'
FER:24:028:C	And that's when
FER:24:029:C	I'll be waitin' at the front gate
FER:24:030:C	That's when, when I see your face
FER:24:031:C	I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"
FER:24:032:B	And you said, "Honestly
FER:24:033:B	When you were gone
FER:24:034:B	Did you ever think of me?"
FER:24:035:C	And I said, "That's when
FER:24:036:C	When I woke up in the morning
FER:24:037:C	That's when it was sunny or stormin'
FER:24:038:C	Laughin', when I was cryin'
FER:24:039:C	And that's when
FER:24:040:C	You were waitin' at the front gate
FER:24:041:C	That's when, when I saw your face
FER:24:042:C	You let me in, and baby, that's when"
FER:24:043:I	(That's when)
FER:24:044:I	(When I woke up in the morning) Yeah
FER:24:045:I	(That's when it was sunny or stormin')
FER:24:046:I	When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin'
FER:24:047:I	(That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate)
FER:24:048:I	That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
FER:24:049:I	(That's when, when I see your face)
FER:24:050:I	That's when I love you, that's when
FER:25:001:V	Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
FER:25:002:V	It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
FER:25:003:V	I heard she's nothin' like me
FER:25:004:V	I'm sure she'll make you happy
FER:25:005:C	But don't you
FER:25:006:C	Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
FER:25:007:C	Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
FER:25:008:C	You don't know how much I feel I love you still
FER:25:009:C	So why don't you, don't you?
FER:25:010:V	Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
FER:25:011:V	I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
FER:25:012:V	My heart knows what the truth is
FER:25:013:V	I swore I wouldn't do this
FER:25:014:C	But don't you
FER:25:015:C	Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
FER:25:016:C	Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
FER:25:017:C	You don't know how much I feel I love you still
FER:25:018:C	So why don't you, don't you?
FER:25:019:B	So I'll walk out of here tonight
FER:25:020:B	Try to go on with my life
FER:25:021:B	And you can say we're still friends
FER:25:022:B	(But I don't wanna pretend)
FER:25:023:B	So if I see you again
FER:25:024:C	Don't you (Don't you)
FER:25:025:C	Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
FER:25:026:C	Don't you (Don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
FER:25:027:C	You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
FER:25:028:C	So why don't you, don't you?
FER:25:029:I	Don't you
FER:26:001:V	It wasn't just like a movie
FER:26:002:V	The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
FER:26:003:V	I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
FER:26:004:V	This is the last time I'll drive this way again
FER:26:005:V	Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
FER:26:006:V	'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't
FER:26:007:C	Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
FER:26:008:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:009:C	I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
FER:26:010:C	And all I have is your sympathy
FER:26:011:C	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
FER:26:012:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:013:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:014:V	The picture frame is empty
FER:26:015:V	On the dresser, vacant just like me
FER:26:016:V	I see your writing on the dash
FER:26:017:V	Then back to your hesitation
FER:26:018:V	I was so sure of everything
FER:26:019:V	Everything I thought we'd always have
FER:26:020:V	Guess I never doubted it
FER:26:021:V	Then the here and the now floods in
FER:26:022:V	Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
FER:26:023:C	Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
FER:26:024:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:025:C	I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
FER:26:026:C	And all I have is your sympathy
FER:26:027:C	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
FER:26:028:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:029:B	And there's so much that I can't touch
FER:26:030:B	You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
FER:26:031:B	And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
FER:26:032:B	And I'm so scared of how this ends
FER:26:033:C	Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
FER:26:034:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:035:C	I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
FER:26:036:C	And all I have is your sympathy
FER:26:037:C	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
FER:26:038:C	Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
FER:26:039:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:040:C	I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
FER:26:041:C	And all I have is your sympathy
FER:26:042:C	'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
FER:26:043:C	Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
FER:26:044:C	Bye, bye, baby
FER:26:045:C	Bye, bye, baby
SPN:01:001:I	Ah-ah, ah-ah
SPN:01:002:I	Ah-ah, ah-ah
SPN:01:003:V	You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
SPN:01:004:V	Left a small town, never looked back
SPN:01:005:V	I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
SPN:01:006:V	Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
SPN:01:007:C	I say, "Can you believe it?"
SPN:01:008:C	As we're lying on the couch
SPN:01:009:C	The moment I could see it
SPN:01:010:C	Yes, yes, I can see it now
SPN:01:011:C	Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
SPN:01:012:C	You put your arm around me for the first time
SPN:01:013:C	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
SPN:01:014:C	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
SPN:01:015:V	Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
SPN:01:016:V	And there's a drawer of my things at your place
SPN:01:017:V	You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
SPN:01:018:V	You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
SPN:01:019:C	But we got bills to pay
SPN:01:020:C	We got nothing figured out
SPN:01:021:C	When it was hard to take
SPN:01:022:C	Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
SPN:01:023:C	Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
SPN:01:024:C	You put your arm around me for the first time
SPN:01:025:C	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
SPN:01:026:C	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
SPN:01:027:C	Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
SPN:01:028:C	You saw me start to believe for the first time
SPN:01:029:C	You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
SPN:01:030:C	You are the best thing that's ever been mine
SPN:01:031:C	Oh-oh, oh
SPN:01:032:B	And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
SPN:01:033:B	As everything was slipping right out of our hands
SPN:01:034:B	I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
SPN:01:035:B	Braced myself for the goodbye
SPN:01:036:B	'Cause it's all I've ever known
SPN:01:037:B	Then you took me by surprise
SPN:01:038:B	You said, "I'll never leave you alone" (Oh)
SPN:01:039:C	You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
SPN:01:040:C	And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
SPN:01:041:C	I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
SPN:01:042:C	She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
SPN:01:043:C	Hold on, make it last
SPN:01:044:C	Hold on, never turn back
SPN:01:045:C	(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
SPN:01:046:C	(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine
SPN:01:047:I	Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
SPN:01:048:I	We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
SPN:01:049:I	And I can see it (Yeah, yeah)
SPN:01:050:I	I can see it now
SPN:02:001:V	The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
SPN:02:002:V	And I'm a house of cards
SPN:02:003:V	You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
SPN:02:004:V	But I kinda know that I won't get far
SPN:02:005:V	And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
SPN:02:006:V	Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
SPN:02:007:C	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
SPN:02:008:C	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
SPN:02:009:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:010:C	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
SPN:02:011:C	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
SPN:02:012:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:013:V	My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
SPN:02:014:V	You touch me once and it's really somethin'
SPN:02:015:V	You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
SPN:02:016:V	I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
SPN:02:017:V	But with you, I know it's no good
SPN:02:018:V	And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
SPN:02:019:C	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
SPN:02:020:C	Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
SPN:02:021:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:022:C	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
SPN:02:023:C	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
SPN:02:024:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:025:B	I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
SPN:02:026:B	Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
SPN:02:027:B	It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
SPN:02:028:B	And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
SPN:02:029:B	I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show
SPN:02:030:C	Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
SPN:02:031:C	Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
SPN:02:032:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:033:C	Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
SPN:02:034:C	Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
SPN:02:035:C	'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
SPN:02:036:I	And the sparks fly
SPN:02:037:I	Oh, baby, smile
SPN:02:038:I	And the sparks fly
SPN:03:001:V	I'm so glad you made time to see me
SPN:03:002:V	How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
SPN:03:003:V	I haven't seen them in a while
SPN:03:004:V	You've been good, busier than ever
SPN:03:005:V	We small talk, work and the weather
SPN:03:006:V	Your guard is up and I know why
SPN:03:007:C	Because the last time you saw me
SPN:03:008:C	Is still burned in the back of your mind
SPN:03:009:C	You gave me roses and I left them there to die
SPN:03:010:C	So, this is me swallowing my pride
SPN:03:011:C	Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
SPN:03:012:C	And I go back to December all the time
SPN:03:013:C	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
SPN:03:014:C	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
SPN:03:015:C	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
SPN:03:016:C	I go back to December all the time
SPN:03:017:V	These days, I haven't been sleeping
SPN:03:018:V	Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
SPN:03:019:V	When your birthday passed and I didn't call
SPN:03:020:V	Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
SPN:03:021:V	I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
SPN:03:022:V	And realized I loved you in the fall
SPN:03:023:C	And then the cold came, the dark days
SPN:03:024:C	When fear crept into my mind
SPN:03:025:C	You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
SPN:03:026:C	So, this is me swallowing my pride
SPN:03:027:C	Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
SPN:03:028:C	And I go back to December all the time
SPN:03:029:C	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
SPN:03:030:C	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
SPN:03:031:C	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
SPN:03:032:C	I go back to December all the time
SPN:03:033:B	I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
SPN:03:034:B	So good to me, so right
SPN:03:035:B	And how you held me in your arms that September night
SPN:03:036:B	The first time you ever saw me cry
SPN:03:037:B	Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
SPN:03:038:B	Probably mindless dreaming
SPN:03:039:B	But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
SPN:03:040:B	I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
SPN:03:041:B	So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
SPN:03:042:C	But this is me swallowing my pride
SPN:03:043:C	Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
SPN:03:044:C	And I go back to December
SPN:03:045:C	It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
SPN:03:046:C	Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
SPN:03:047:C	I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
SPN:03:048:C	I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
SPN:03:049:C	I go back to December all the time
SPN:03:050:I	All the time
SPN:04:001:V	I am not the kind of girl
SPN:04:002:V	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
SPN:04:003:V	But you are not the kind of boy
SPN:04:004:V	Who should be marrying the wrong girl
SPN:04:005:V	I sneak in and see your friends
SPN:04:006:V	And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
SPN:04:007:V	And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
SPN:04:008:V	Somewhere back inside a room
SPN:04:009:V	Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
SPN:04:010:C	This is surely not what you thought it would be
SPN:04:011:C	I lose myself in a daydream
SPN:04:012:C	Where I stand and say
SPN:04:013:C	Don't say yes, run away now
SPN:04:014:C	I'll meet you when you're out
SPN:04:015:C	Of the church, at the back door
SPN:04:016:C	Don't wait or say a single vow
SPN:04:017:C	You need to hear me out
SPN:04:018:C	And they said, "Speak now"
SPN:04:019:V	Fond gestures are exchanged
SPN:04:020:V	And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
SPN:04:021:V	And I am hiding in the curtains
SPN:04:022:V	It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
SPN:04:023:C	She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
SPN:04:024:C	But I know you wish it was me
SPN:04:025:C	You wish it was me, don't you?
SPN:04:026:C	Don't say yes, run away now
SPN:04:027:C	I'll meet you when you're out
SPN:04:028:C	Of the church, at the back door
SPN:04:029:C	Don't wait or say a single vow
SPN:04:030:C	You need to hear me out
SPN:04:031:C	And they said, "Speak now"
SPN:04:032:C	Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
SPN:04:033:C	I'll meet you when you're out
SPN:04:034:C	Of the church, at the back door
SPN:04:035:C	Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
SPN:04:036:C	Your time is running out
SPN:04:037:C	And they said, "Speak now"
SPN:04:038:C	Ooh (Run away now), la
SPN:04:039:C	Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
SPN:04:040:B	I hear the preacher say
SPN:04:041:B	"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
SPN:04:042:B	There's the silence, there's my last chance
SPN:04:043:B	I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
SPN:04:044:B	Horrified looks from everyone in the room
SPN:04:045:B	But I'm only lookin' at you
SPN:04:046:V	I am not the kind of girl
SPN:04:047:V	Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
SPN:04:048:V	But you are not the kind of boy
SPN:04:049:V	Who should be marrying the wrong girl, ha-ha
SPN:04:050:C	So, don't say yes, run away now
SPN:04:051:C	I'll meet you when you're out
SPN:04:052:C	Of the church, at the back door
SPN:04:053:C	Don't wait or say a single vow
SPN:04:054:C	You need to hear me out
SPN:04:055:C	They said, "Speak now"
SPN:04:056:C	And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
SPN:04:057:C	I'll meet you when I'm out
SPN:04:058:C	Of my tux, at the back door
SPN:04:059:C	Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
SPN:04:060:C	So glad you were around
SPN:04:061:C	When they said, 'Speak now'
SPN:05:001:V	Long were the nights
SPN:05:002:V	When my days once revolved around you
SPN:05:003:V	Counting my footsteps
SPN:05:004:V	Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
SPN:05:005:V	And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
SPN:05:006:V	But I swore I was fine
SPN:05:007:V	You paint me a blue sky
SPN:05:008:V	Then go back and turn it to rain
SPN:05:009:V	And I lived in your chess game
SPN:05:010:V	But you change the rules every day
SPN:05:011:V	Wonderin' which version of you
SPN:05:012:V	I might get on the phone tonight
SPN:05:013:V	Well, I stopped pickin' up
SPN:05:014:V	And this song is to let you know why
SPN:05:015:C	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
SPN:05:016:C	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
SPN:05:017:C	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
SPN:05:018:C	I shoulda known
SPN:05:019:V	Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
SPN:05:020:V	Or maybe it's you and your sick need
SPN:05:021:V	To give love and take it away
SPN:05:022:V	And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
SPN:05:023:V	Who don't understand
SPN:05:024:V	And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
SPN:05:025:V	"Run as fast as you can"
SPN:05:026:C	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
SPN:05:027:C	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
SPN:05:028:C	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
SPN:05:029:C	Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
SPN:05:030:C	Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
SPN:05:031:C	Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
SPN:05:032:C	I shoulda known
SPN:05:033:B	You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
SPN:05:034:B	Never impressed by me acing your tests
SPN:05:035:B	All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
SPN:05:036:B	'Cause you burned them out
SPN:05:037:B	But I took your matches before fire could catch me
SPN:05:038:B	So don't look now
SPN:05:039:B	I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
SPN:05:040:B	Oh
SPN:05:041:C	Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
SPN:05:042:C	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
SPN:05:043:C	The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
SPN:05:044:C	I see it all now that you're gone
SPN:05:045:C	Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
SPN:05:046:C	The girl in the dress wrote you a song
SPN:05:047:C	You shoulda known
SPN:05:048:I	You shoulda known
SPN:05:049:I	Don't you think I was too young?
SPN:05:050:I	You shoulda known
SPN:06:001:V	You, with your words like knives
SPN:06:002:V	And swords and weapons that you use against me
SPN:06:003:V	You have knocked me off my feet again
SPN:06:004:V	Got me feelin' like a nothing
SPN:06:005:V	You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
SPN:06:006:V	Calling me out when I'm wounded
SPN:06:007:V	You, pickin' on the weaker man
SPN:06:008:C	Well, you can take me down
SPN:06:009:C	With just one single blow
SPN:06:010:C	But you don't know what you don't know
SPN:06:011:C	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
SPN:06:012:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:013:C	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
SPN:06:014:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:015:C	Why you gotta be so mean?
SPN:06:016:V	You, with your switching sides
SPN:06:017:V	And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
SPN:06:018:V	You have pointed out my flaws again
SPN:06:019:V	As if I don't already see them
SPN:06:020:V	I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
SPN:06:021:V	'Cause I'll never impress you
SPN:06:022:V	I just wanna feel okay again
SPN:06:023:C	I bet you got pushed around
SPN:06:024:C	Somebody made you cold
SPN:06:025:C	But the cycle ends right now
SPN:06:026:C	'Cause you can't lead me down that road
SPN:06:027:C	And you don't know what you don't know
SPN:06:028:C	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
SPN:06:029:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:030:C	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
SPN:06:031:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:032:C	Why you gotta be so mean?
SPN:06:033:B	And I can see you years from now in a bar
SPN:06:034:B	Talking over a football game
SPN:06:035:B	With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
SPN:06:036:B	Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
SPN:06:037:B	Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
SPN:06:038:B	But all you are is mean
SPN:06:039:B	All you are is mean
SPN:06:040:B	And a liar, and pathetic
SPN:06:041:B	And alone in life, and mean
SPN:06:042:B	And mean, and mean, and mean
SPN:06:043:C	But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
SPN:06:044:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
SPN:06:045:C	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
SPN:06:046:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:047:C	Why you gotta be so mean?
SPN:06:048:C	Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
SPN:06:049:C	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
SPN:06:050:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:051:C	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
SPN:06:052:C	Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
SPN:06:053:C	(Why you gotta be so mean?)
SPN:06:054:C	And all you're ever gonna be is mean
SPN:06:055:C	Why you gotta be so mean?
SPN:07:001:V	I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
SPN:07:002:V	How we met and the sparks flew instantly
SPN:07:003:V	And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
SPN:07:004:V	I used to know my place was the spot next to you
SPN:07:005:V	Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
SPN:07:006:V	'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
SPN:07:007:C	Oh, a simple complication
SPN:07:008:C	Miscommunications lead to fallout
SPN:07:009:C	So many things that I wish you knew
SPN:07:010:C	So many walls up, I can't break through
SPN:07:011:C	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
SPN:07:012:C	And we're not speakin'
SPN:07:013:C	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
SPN:07:014:C	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
SPN:07:015:C	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
SPN:07:016:C	When it all broke down
SPN:07:017:C	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
SPN:07:018:C	Next chapter
SPN:07:019:V	How'd we end up this way?
SPN:07:020:V	See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
SPN:07:021:V	And you're doin' your best to avoid me
SPN:07:022:V	I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
SPN:07:023:V	How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
SPN:07:024:V	But you held your pride like you should've held me
SPN:07:025:C	Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
SPN:07:026:C	Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
SPN:07:027:C	I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
SPN:07:028:C	I've never heard silence quite this loud
SPN:07:029:C	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
SPN:07:030:C	And we're not speakin'
SPN:07:031:C	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
SPN:07:032:C	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
SPN:07:033:C	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
SPN:07:034:C	When it all broke down
SPN:07:035:C	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
SPN:07:036:B	This is looking like a contest
SPN:07:037:B	Of who can act like they care less
SPN:07:038:B	But I liked it better when you were on my side
SPN:07:039:B	The battle's in your hands now
SPN:07:040:B	But I would lay my armor down
SPN:07:041:B	If you said you'd rather love than fight
SPN:07:042:C	So many things that you wish I knew
SPN:07:043:C	But the story of us might be ending soon
SPN:07:044:C	Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
SPN:07:045:C	And we're not speakin'
SPN:07:046:C	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
SPN:07:047:C	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
SPN:07:048:C	And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
SPN:07:049:C	When it all broke down
SPN:07:050:C	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
SPN:07:051:C	And we're not speakin'
SPN:07:052:C	And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
SPN:07:053:C	Like it's killin' me? Yeah
SPN:07:054:C	I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
SPN:07:055:C	'Cause we're goin' down
SPN:07:056:C	And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
SPN:07:057:I	The end
SPN:08:001:V	Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
SPN:08:002:V	And it's so quiet in the world tonight
SPN:08:003:V	Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
SPN:08:004:V	So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
SPN:08:005:C	To you, everything's funny
SPN:08:006:C	You got nothing to regret
SPN:08:007:C	I'd give all I have, honey
SPN:08:008:C	If you could stay like that
SPN:08:009:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:010:C	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
SPN:08:011:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:012:C	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
SPN:08:013:C	I won't let nobody hurt you
SPN:08:014:C	Won't let no one break your heart
SPN:08:015:C	And no one will desert you
SPN:08:016:C	Just try to never grow up
SPN:08:017:C	And never grow up
SPN:08:018:V	You're in the car, on the way to the movies
SPN:08:019:V	And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
SPN:08:020:V	At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
SPN:08:021:V	And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
SPN:08:022:C	But don't make her drop you off around the block
SPN:08:023:C	Remember that she's gettin' older, too
SPN:08:024:C	And don't lose the way that you dance around
SPN:08:025:C	In your PJs getting ready for school
SPN:08:026:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:027:C	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
SPN:08:028:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:029:C	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
SPN:08:030:C	And no one's ever burned you
SPN:08:031:C	Nothing's ever left you scarred
SPN:08:032:C	And even though you want to
SPN:08:033:C	Just try to never grow up
SPN:08:034:B	Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
SPN:08:035:B	Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
SPN:08:036:B	Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
SPN:08:037:B	And all your little brother's favorite songs
SPN:08:038:B	I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone
SPN:08:039:V	So, here I am in my new apartment
SPN:08:040:V	In a big city, they just dropped me off
SPN:08:041:V	It's so much colder than I thought it would be
SPN:08:042:V	So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
SPN:08:043:C	Wish I'd never grown up
SPN:08:044:C	Wish I'd never grown up
SPN:08:045:C	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
SPN:08:046:C	Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
SPN:08:047:C	Oh, I don't wanna grow up
SPN:08:048:C	Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
SPN:08:049:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:050:C	Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
SPN:08:051:C	Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
SPN:08:052:C	Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
SPN:08:053:C	I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
SPN:08:054:C	Won't let no one break your heart
SPN:08:055:C	And even though you want to
SPN:08:056:C	Please, try to never grow up
SPN:08:057:I	Oh, oh (Never grow up)
SPN:08:058:I	Just never grow up
SPN:08:059:I	Oh (Never grow up)
SPN:08:060:I	Just never grow up
SPN:09:001:V	There I was again tonight
SPN:09:002:V	Forcing laughter, faking smiles
SPN:09:003:V	Same old tired, lonely place
SPN:09:004:V	Walls of insincerity
SPN:09:005:V	Shifting eyes and vacancy
SPN:09:006:V	Vanished when I saw your face
SPN:09:007:V	All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
SPN:09:008:V	Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
SPN:09:009:V	Across the room, your silhouette
SPN:09:010:V	Starts to make its way to me
SPN:09:011:V	The playful conversation starts
SPN:09:012:V	Counter all your quick remarks
SPN:09:013:V	Like passing notes in secrecy
SPN:09:014:V	And it was enchanting to meet you
SPN:09:015:V	All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:016:C	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
SPN:09:017:C	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
SPN:09:018:C	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
SPN:09:019:C	I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:020:V	The lingering question kept me up
SPN:09:021:V	2AM, who do you love?
SPN:09:022:V	I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
SPN:09:023:V	And now, I'm pacing back and forth
SPN:09:024:V	Wishing you were at my door
SPN:09:025:V	I'd open up and you would say
SPN:09:026:V	"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
SPN:09:027:V	All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:028:C	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
SPN:09:029:C	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
SPN:09:030:C	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
SPN:09:031:C	This night is flawless, don't you let it go
SPN:09:032:C	I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
SPN:09:033:C	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
SPN:09:034:C	I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:035:B	This is me praying that
SPN:09:036:B	This was the very first page
SPN:09:037:B	Not where the storyline ends
SPN:09:038:B	My thoughts will echo your name
SPN:09:039:B	Until I see you again
SPN:09:040:B	These are the words I held back
SPN:09:041:B	As I was leaving too soon
SPN:09:042:B	I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:043:B	Please, don't be in love with someone else
SPN:09:044:B	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
SPN:09:045:B	Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
SPN:09:046:B	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)
SPN:09:047:C	This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
SPN:09:048:C	I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
SPN:09:049:C	I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
SPN:09:050:C	This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
SPN:09:051:C	Don't you let it go
SPN:09:052:C	I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
SPN:09:053:C	Dancing around all alone
SPN:09:054:C	I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
SPN:09:055:C	Wonderin' if you knew
SPN:09:056:C	I was enchanted to meet you
SPN:09:057:I	Please, don't be in love with someone else
SPN:09:058:I	Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
SPN:10:001:I	Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
SPN:10:002:I	ha-ha, time for a little revenge
SPN:10:003:V	The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
SPN:10:004:V	I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
SPN:10:005:V	She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
SPN:10:006:V	She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
SPN:10:007:V	I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
SPN:10:008:V	I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
SPN:10:009:V	She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
SPN:10:010:V	She underestimated just who she was stealin' from
SPN:10:011:C	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
SPN:10:012:C	She's an actress, woah
SPN:10:013:C	He was a moth to the flame
SPN:10:014:C	She was holding the matches, woah
SPN:10:015:C	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
SPN:10:016:C	On the playground won't make you many friends
SPN:10:017:C	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
SPN:10:018:C	There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha
SPN:10:019:V	She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
SPN:10:020:V	She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
SPN:10:021:V	I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
SPN:10:022:V	She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
SPN:10:023:V	But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
SPN:10:024:V	Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
SPN:10:025:V	They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
SPN:10:026:V	That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
SPN:10:027:V	(Think about what you did)
SPN:10:028:C	She's not a saint and she's not what you think
SPN:10:029:C	She's an actress, woah
SPN:10:030:C	He was a moth to the flame
SPN:10:031:C	She was holding the matches, woah
SPN:10:032:C	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
SPN:10:033:C	On the playground won't make you many friends
SPN:10:034:C	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
SPN:10:035:C	There is nothing I do better than revenge (ha-ha)
SPN:10:036:B	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
SPN:10:037:B	You might have him, but haven't you heard?
SPN:10:038:B	I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
SPN:10:039:B	You might have him, but I always get the last word
SPN:10:040:B	Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)
SPN:10:041:C	She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
SPN:10:042:C	She's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)
SPN:10:043:C	He was a moth to the flame
SPN:10:044:C	She was holding the matches, woah
SPN:10:045:C	Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
SPN:10:046:C	On the playground won't make you many friends
SPN:10:047:C	She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
SPN:10:048:C	There is nothing I do better than revenge
SPN:10:049:I	(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
SPN:10:050:I	'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
SPN:10:051:I	Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
SPN:10:052:I	I don't think you do, I don't think you do
SPN:10:053:I	Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
SPN:10:054:I	Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)
SPN:10:055:I	(So much better, yeah?)
SPN:10:056:I	So you deserve some applause
SPN:10:057:I	'Cause you're so much better
SPN:10:058:I	She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"
SPN:11:001:V	I guess you really did it this time
SPN:11:002:V	Left yourself in your war path
SPN:11:003:V	Lost your balance on a tightrope
SPN:11:004:V	Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
SPN:11:005:C	Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
SPN:11:006:C	Always a bigger bed to crawl into
SPN:11:007:C	Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
SPN:11:008:C	And everybody believed in you?
SPN:11:009:C	It's alright, just wait and see
SPN:11:010:C	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
SPN:11:011:C	Who you are is not where you've been
SPN:11:012:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:013:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:014:V	Did some things you can't speak of
SPN:11:015:V	But at night, you live it all again
SPN:11:016:V	You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
SPN:11:017:V	If only you had seen what you know now then
SPN:11:018:C	Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
SPN:11:019:C	When everything out of reach
SPN:11:020:C	Someone bigger brought down to you
SPN:11:021:C	Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
SPN:11:022:C	Before the monsters caught up to you?
SPN:11:023:C	It's alright, just wait and see
SPN:11:024:C	Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
SPN:11:025:C	Who you are is not where you've been
SPN:11:026:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:027:C	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
SPN:11:028:C	Thirty-two and still growing up now
SPN:11:029:C	Who you are is not what you did
SPN:11:030:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:031:B	Time turns flames to embers
SPN:11:032:B	You'll have new Septembers
SPN:11:033:B	Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
SPN:11:034:B	Minds change like the weather
SPN:11:035:B	I hope you remember
SPN:11:036:B	Today is never too late to be brand new
SPN:11:037:B	Oh, oh
SPN:11:038:C	It's alright, just wait and see
SPN:11:039:C	Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
SPN:11:040:C	Who you are is not where you've been
SPN:11:041:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:042:C	It's okay, life is a tough crowd
SPN:11:043:C	Thirty-two and still growing up now
SPN:11:044:C	Who you are is not what you did
SPN:11:045:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:046:C	You're still an innocent
SPN:11:047:I	Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
SPN:11:048:I	It's never too late to get it back
SPN:12:001:V	You and I walk a fragile line
SPN:12:002:V	I have known it all this time
SPN:12:003:V	But I never thought I'd live to see it break
SPN:12:004:V	It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
SPN:12:005:V	And I can't trust anything now
SPN:12:006:V	And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
SPN:12:007:C	Oh, holding my breath
SPN:12:008:C	Won't lose you again
SPN:12:009:C	Something's made your eyes go cold
SPN:12:010:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:011:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:012:C	Something's gone terribly wrong
SPN:12:013:C	You're all I wanted
SPN:12:014:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:015:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:016:C	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
SPN:12:017:C	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
SPN:12:018:V	Stood there and watched you walk away
SPN:12:019:V	From everything we had
SPN:12:020:V	But I still mean every word I said to you
SPN:12:021:V	He will try to take away my pain
SPN:12:022:V	And he just might make me smile
SPN:12:023:V	But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
SPN:12:024:C	Oh, holding my breath
SPN:12:025:C	Won't see you again
SPN:12:026:C	Something keeps me holding onto nothing
SPN:12:027:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:028:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:029:C	Something's gone terribly wrong
SPN:12:030:C	You're all I wanted
SPN:12:031:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:032:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:033:C	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
SPN:12:034:C	Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
SPN:12:035:B	I know, I know
SPN:12:036:B	I just know
SPN:12:037:B	You're not gone
SPN:12:038:B	You can't be gone, no
SPN:12:039:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:040:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:041:C	Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong)
SPN:12:042:C	Won't finish what you started
SPN:12:043:C	Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
SPN:12:044:C	I thought I had you figured out
SPN:12:045:C	Can't breathe whenever you're gone
SPN:12:046:C	I can't go back, I'm haunted
SPN:12:047:I	Oh
SPN:12:048:I	You and I walk a fragile line
SPN:12:049:I	I have known it all this time
SPN:12:050:I	Never ever thought I'd see it break
SPN:12:051:I	Never thought I'd see it
SPN:13:001:V	I still remember the look on your face
SPN:13:002:V	Lit through the darkness at 1:58
SPN:13:003:V	The words that you whispered for just us to know
SPN:13:004:V	You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
SPN:13:005:V	Away
SPN:13:006:V	I do recall now, the smell of the rain
SPN:13:007:V	Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
SPN:13:008:V	That July ninth, the beat of your heart
SPN:13:009:V	It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
SPN:13:010:C	But now I'll go
SPN:13:011:C	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
SPN:13:012:C	All that I know is I don't know
SPN:13:013:C	How to be somethin' you miss
SPN:13:014:C	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
SPN:13:015:C	I never imagined we'd end like this
SPN:13:016:C	Your name, forever the name on my lips
SPN:13:017:V	I do remember the swing of your step
SPN:13:018:V	The life of the party, you're showin' off again
SPN:13:019:V	And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
SPN:13:020:V	I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
SPN:13:021:V	Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
SPN:13:022:V	I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
SPN:13:023:V	How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
SPN:13:024:V	There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
SPN:13:025:C	And I'll go
SPN:13:026:C	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
SPN:13:027:C	All that I know is I don't know
SPN:13:028:C	How to be somethin' you miss
SPN:13:029:C	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
SPN:13:030:C	I never imagined we'd end like this
SPN:13:031:C	Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm
SPN:13:032:B	So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
SPN:13:033:B	And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
SPN:13:034:B	And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
SPN:13:035:B	Hope it's nice where you are
SPN:13:036:V	And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
SPN:13:037:V	And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
SPN:13:038:V	You can plan for a change in the weather and time
SPN:13:039:V	But I never planned on you changing your mind
SPN:13:040:C	So I'll go
SPN:13:041:C	Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
SPN:13:042:C	All that I know is I don't know
SPN:13:043:C	How to be somethin' you miss
SPN:13:044:C	I never thought we'd have a last kiss
SPN:13:045:C	I never imagined we'd end like this
SPN:13:046:C	Your name, forever the name on my lips
SPN:13:047:I	Just like our last kiss
SPN:13:048:I	Forever the name on my lips
SPN:13:049:I	Forever the name on my lips
SPN:13:050:I	Just like our last
SPN:14:001:V	I said, "Remember this moment"
SPN:14:002:V	In the back of my mind
SPN:14:003:V	The time we stood with our shaking hands
SPN:14:004:V	The crowds in stands went wild
SPN:14:005:V	We were the kings and the queens
SPN:14:006:V	And they read off our names
SPN:14:007:V	The night you danced like you knew our lives
SPN:14:008:V	Would never be the same
SPN:14:009:V	You held your head like a hero
SPN:14:010:V	On a history book page
SPN:14:011:V	It was the end of a decade
SPN:14:012:V	But the start of an age
SPN:14:013:C	Long live the walls we crashed through
SPN:14:014:C	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
SPN:14:015:C	I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
SPN:14:016:C	And bring on all the pretenders
SPN:14:017:C	One day, we will be remembered
SPN:14:018:V	I said, "Remember this feeling"
SPN:14:019:V	I pass the pictures around
SPN:14:020:V	Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
SPN:14:021:V	Wishin' for right now
SPN:14:022:V	We are the kings and the queens
SPN:14:023:V	You traded your baseball cap for a crown
SPN:14:024:V	When they gave us our trophies
SPN:14:025:V	And we held them up for our town
SPN:14:026:V	And the cynics were outraged
SPN:14:027:V	Screaming, "This is absurd"
SPN:14:028:V	'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
SPN:14:029:V	In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
SPN:14:030:C	Long live the walls we crashed through
SPN:14:031:C	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
SPN:14:032:C	I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
SPN:14:033:C	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
SPN:14:034:C	Long live all the mountains we moved
SPN:14:035:C	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
SPN:14:036:C	I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
SPN:14:037:C	And bring on all the pretenders
SPN:14:038:C	One day, we will be remembered
SPN:14:039:B	Hold on to spinning around
SPN:14:040:B	Confetti falls to the ground
SPN:14:041:B	May these memories break our fall
SPN:14:042:B	Will you take a moment? Promise me this
SPN:14:043:B	That you'll stand by me forever
SPN:14:044:B	But if, god forbid, fate should step in
SPN:14:045:B	And force us into a goodbye
SPN:14:046:B	If you have children some day
SPN:14:047:B	When they point to the pictures
SPN:14:048:B	Please, tell 'em my name
SPN:14:049:B	Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
SPN:14:050:B	Tell 'em how I hope they shine
SPN:14:051:B	Long live the walls we crashed through
SPN:14:052:B	I had the time of my life with you
SPN:14:053:C	Long, long live the walls we crashed through
SPN:14:054:C	How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
SPN:14:055:C	And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
SPN:14:056:C	And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
SPN:14:057:C	Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
SPN:14:058:C	I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
SPN:14:059:C	And long, long live that look on your face
SPN:14:060:C	And bring on all the pretenders
SPN:14:061:C	One day, we will be remembered
SPN:15:001:V	Elevator buttons and morning air
SPN:15:002:V	Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
SPN:15:003:V	If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
SPN:15:004:V	But right now, my time is theirs
SPN:15:005:V	Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
SPN:15:006:V	They'll judge it like they know about me and you
SPN:15:007:V	And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
SPN:15:008:V	The jury's out, but my choice is you
SPN:15:009:C	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
SPN:15:010:C	People throw rocks at things that shine
SPN:15:011:C	And life makes love look hard
SPN:15:012:C	The stakes are high, the water's rough
SPN:15:013:C	But this love is ours
SPN:15:014:V	You never know what people have up their sleeves
SPN:15:015:V	Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
SPN:15:016:V	Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
SPN:15:017:V	But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
SPN:15:018:V	And you'll say
SPN:15:019:C	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
SPN:15:020:C	People throw rocks at things that shine
SPN:15:021:C	And life makes love look hard
SPN:15:022:C	The stakes are high, the water's rough
SPN:15:023:C	But this love is ours
SPN:15:024:B	And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
SPN:15:025:B	Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
SPN:15:026:B	I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
SPN:15:027:B	'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
SPN:15:028:B	And I love the riddles that you speak
SPN:15:029:B	And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
SPN:15:030:B	Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
SPN:15:031:C	So don't you worry your pretty little mind
SPN:15:032:C	People throw rocks at things that shine
SPN:15:033:C	And life makes love look hard
SPN:15:034:C	Don't you worry your pretty little mind
SPN:15:035:C	People throw rocks at things that shine
SPN:15:036:C	But they can't take what's ours
SPN:15:037:C	They can't take what's ours
SPN:15:038:C	The stakes are high, the water's rough
SPN:15:039:C	But this love is ours
SPN:16:001:V	Tall, dark, and Superman
SPN:16:002:V	He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
SPN:16:003:V	To save the world or go to work
SPN:16:004:V	It's the same thing to me
SPN:16:005:V	He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
SPN:16:006:V	I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
SPN:16:007:V	I hang on every word you say
SPN:16:008:V	And you smile and say, "How are you?”
SPN:16:009:V	And I'll say, "Just fine"
SPN:16:010:V	I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
SPN:16:011:V	I love you forever
SPN:16:012:C	I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:013:C	You've got a busy day today
SPN:16:014:C	Go save the world, I'll be around
SPN:16:015:C	And I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:016:C	Come back, I'll be with you someday
SPN:16:017:C	I'll be right here on the ground
SPN:16:018:C	When you come back down
SPN:16:019:V	Tall, dark and beautiful
SPN:16:020:V	He's complicated, he's irrational
SPN:16:021:V	But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
SPN:16:022:V	Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
SPN:16:023:V	He's not all bad like his reputation
SPN:16:024:V	And I can't hear one single word they say
SPN:16:025:V	And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
SPN:16:026:V	I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
SPN:16:027:V	I loved you from the very first day
SPN:16:028:C	I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:029:C	You've got a busy day today
SPN:16:030:C	Go save the world, I'll be around
SPN:16:031:C	And I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:032:C	Come back, I'll be with you someday
SPN:16:033:C	I'll be right here on the ground
SPN:16:034:C	When you come back down
SPN:16:035:B	And I watch you fly around the world
SPN:16:036:B	And I hope you don't save some other girl
SPN:16:037:B	Don't forget, don't forget about me
SPN:16:038:B	I'm far away, but I never let you go
SPN:16:039:B	I'm love-struck and looking out the window
SPN:16:040:B	Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
SPN:16:041:B	Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
SPN:16:042:B	Wishing the card was from you
SPN:16:043:B	Wishing the call was from you
SPN:16:044:B	'Cause I loved you from the very first day
SPN:16:045:C	I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:046:C	You've got a busy day today
SPN:16:047:C	Go save the world, I'll be around
SPN:16:048:C	Forever and ever
SPN:16:049:C	And I watch Superman fly away
SPN:16:050:C	I swear, I'll be with you someday
SPN:16:051:C	I'll be right here on the ground
SPN:16:052:C	When you come back down
SPN:16:053:I	La, la, la, la, la, la
SPN:16:054:I	La, la, la, la, la, la
SPN:16:055:I	When you come back down
SPN:17:001:V	Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
SPN:17:002:V	Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
SPN:17:003:V	Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
SPN:17:004:V	I've got my money on things goin' badly
SPN:17:005:V	Got a history of stories ending sadly
SPN:17:006:V	Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
SPN:17:007:V	Just one time, just one time
SPN:17:008:C	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
SPN:17:009:C	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
SPN:17:010:C	And I want you now, wanna need you forever
SPN:17:011:C	In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
SPN:17:012:V	I've been left in the rain lost and pining
SPN:17:013:V	I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
SPN:17:014:V	'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
SPN:17:015:V	I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
SPN:17:016:V	I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
SPN:17:017:V	Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
SPN:17:018:V	Just one time, just one time
SPN:17:019:C	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
SPN:17:020:C	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
SPN:17:021:C	And I want you now, wanna need you forever
SPN:17:022:C	In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
SPN:17:023:B	I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
SPN:17:024:B	Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
SPN:17:025:B	And maybe I call you mine
SPN:17:026:B	And you won't need space
SPN:17:027:B	Or string me along while you decide
SPN:17:028:B	And just one time (Just one time)
SPN:17:029:B	Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
SPN:17:030:B	It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
SPN:17:031:C	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
SPN:17:032:C	Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
SPN:17:033:C	All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
SPN:17:034:C	Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
SPN:17:035:C	And I want you now, wanna need you forever
SPN:17:036:C	In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
SPN:18:001:V	When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
SPN:18:002:V	Closes the blinds and locks the door
SPN:18:003:V	When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
SPN:18:004:V	Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
SPN:18:005:V	She waits and takes her time
SPN:18:006:V	'Cause Little-Miss-Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
SPN:18:007:V	When Emma falls in love, I know
SPN:18:008:V	That boy will never be the same
SPN:18:009:C	'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
SPN:18:010:C	Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
SPN:18:011:C	And all the bad boys would be good boys
SPN:18:012:C	If they only had a chance to love her
SPN:18:013:C	And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
SPN:18:014:V	When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
SPN:18:015:V	Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
SPN:18:016:V	When Emma falls in love, she disappears
SPN:18:017:V	And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
SPN:18:018:V	When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
SPN:18:019:V	She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
SPN:18:020:V	'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
SPN:18:021:V	She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave
SPN:18:022:C	And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
SPN:18:023:C	Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
SPN:18:024:C	And all the bad boys would be good boys
SPN:18:025:C	If they only had a chance to love her
SPN:18:026:C	And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
SPN:18:027:B	Well, she's so New-York when she's in L.A.
SPN:18:028:B	She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
SPN:18:029:B	'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
SPN:18:030:B	When Emma falls in love, I'm learning
SPN:18:031:V	Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
SPN:18:032:V	Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
SPN:18:033:V	Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
SPN:18:034:V	Little does he know, his whole world's about to change
SPN:18:035:C	'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
SPN:18:036:C	Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
SPN:18:037:C	And all the bad boys would be good boys
SPN:18:038:C	If they only had a chance to love her
SPN:18:039:C	And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
SPN:18:040:I	Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her
SPN:19:001:I	I-I-I-I
SPN:19:002:V	You brush past me in the hallway
SPN:19:003:V	And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
SPN:19:004:V	I've been watchin' you for ages
SPN:19:005:V	And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
SPN:19:006:C	But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
SPN:19:007:C	What would you do if they never found us out?
SPN:19:008:C	What would you do if we never made a sound?
SPN:19:009:C	'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
SPN:19:010:C	And I could see you up against the wall with me
SPN:19:011:C	And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
SPN:19:012:C	That I can see you
SPN:19:013:C	I-I-I-I
SPN:19:014:V	And we kept everything professional
SPN:19:015:V	But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
SPN:19:016:V	They keep watchful eyes on us
SPN:19:017:V	So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
SPN:19:018:V	You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
SPN:19:019:V	Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet
SPN:19:020:C	But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
SPN:19:021:C	What would you do if they never found us out?
SPN:19:022:C	What would you do if we never made a sound?
SPN:19:023:C	'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
SPN:19:024:C	And I could see you up against the wall with me
SPN:19:025:C	And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
SPN:19:026:C	That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
SPN:19:027:C	I could see you, make me want you even more
SPN:19:028:C	What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
SPN:19:029:C	That I can see you
SPN:19:030:C	I-I-I-I
SPN:19:031:B	I can see you in your suit and your necktie
SPN:19:032:B	Passed me a note sayin', "Meet me tonight"
SPN:19:033:B	Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
SPN:19:034:B	And I could see you being my addiction
SPN:19:035:B	You can see me as a secret mission
SPN:19:036:B	Hide away and I will start behaving myself
SPN:19:037:C	I-I-I-I
SPN:19:038:C	Oh-oh, oh, oh
SPN:19:039:C	I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
SPN:19:040:C	And I could see you up against the wall with me
SPN:19:041:C	And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
SPN:19:042:C	That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
SPN:19:043:C	I could see you, make me want you even more
SPN:19:044:C	What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
SPN:19:045:C	That I can see you, oh, I can see you
SPN:19:046:I	Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
SPN:19:047:I	I see you
SPN:19:048:I	(I-I-I-I) I see you, I see you, baby
SPN:19:049:I	Oh, baby
SPN:20:001:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:20:002:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:20:003:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:20:004:V	Once, I had an empire in a golden age
SPN:20:005:V	I was held up so high, I used to be great
SPN:20:006:V	They used to cheer when they saw my face
SPN:20:007:V	Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
SPN:20:008:C	And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
SPN:20:009:C	And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
SPN:20:010:C	And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
SPN:20:011:C	You don't wanna know me now
SPN:20:012:V	Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
SPN:20:013:V	Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
SPN:20:014:V	Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
SPN:20:015:V	I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
SPN:20:016:C	Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
SPN:20:017:C	Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
SPN:20:018:C	And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
SPN:20:019:C	Falling down like promises that I never kept
SPN:20:020:C	And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
SPN:20:021:C	And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
SPN:20:022:C	And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
SPN:20:023:C	You don't wanna know me now
SPN:20:024:B	My foes and friends watch my reign end
SPN:20:025:B	I don't know how it could've ended this way
SPN:20:026:B	Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
SPN:20:027:B	People look at me like I'm a monster
SPN:20:028:B	Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
SPN:20:029:B	Used to chant my name
SPN:20:030:B	Now they're screaming that they hate me
SPN:20:031:B	Never wanted you to hate me
SPN:20:032:C	My castle's crumbling down
SPN:20:033:C	And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
SPN:20:034:C	And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)
SPN:20:035:C	My castle's crumbling down
SPN:20:036:C	You don't wanna know me now, now
SPN:20:037:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:20:038:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:20:039:I	(Once, I had an empire)
SPN:21:001:V	My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
SPN:21:002:V	Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
SPN:21:003:V	And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
SPN:21:004:V	You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
SPN:21:005:V	Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
SPN:21:006:V	And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
SPN:21:007:C	And the voices say, "You are not the exception
SPN:21:008:C	You will never learn your lesson"
SPN:21:009:C	Foolish one
SPN:21:010:C	Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
SPN:21:011:C	That ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:012:C	You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
SPN:21:013:V	You know how to keep me waitin'
SPN:21:014:V	I know how to act like I'm fine
SPN:21:015:V	Don't know what to call this situation
SPN:21:016:V	But I know I can't call you mine
SPN:21:017:V	And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
SPN:21:018:V	'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
SPN:21:019:V	It starts thinkin' you'll come around
SPN:21:020:V	And maybe, someday, when we're older
SPN:21:021:V	This is something we'll laugh about
SPN:21:022:V	Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
SPN:21:023:C	But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
SPN:21:024:C	You will never learn your lesson"
SPN:21:025:C	Foolish one
SPN:21:026:C	Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
SPN:21:027:C	That ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:028:C	You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
SPN:21:029:C	Foolish one
SPN:21:030:C	Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
SPN:21:031:C	That ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:032:C	You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
SPN:21:033:B	Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
SPN:21:034:B	Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
SPN:21:035:B	Oh, you haven't written me or called
SPN:21:036:B	But goodbye screamin' in the silence
SPN:21:037:B	And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
SPN:21:038:B	'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
SPN:21:039:B	I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
SPN:21:040:B	And you will say you had the best of intentions
SPN:21:041:B	And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
SPN:21:042:C	Foolish one
SPN:21:043:C	Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
SPN:21:044:C	That ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:045:C	You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
SPN:21:046:C	Foolish one
SPN:21:047:C	Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
SPN:21:048:C	That ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:049:C	You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
SPN:21:050:I	La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
SPN:21:051:I	La-la-la-la-la
SPN:21:052:I	Ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:053:I	Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
SPN:21:054:I	Foolish one
SPN:21:055:I	Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
SPN:21:056:I	They ain't never gonna come
SPN:21:057:I	And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
SPN:21:058:I	Foolish one
SPN:21:059:I	The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
SPN:21:060:I	When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
SPN:21:061:I	No, he just wasn't the one
SPN:22:001:V	Down the block, there's an antique shop
SPN:22:002:V	And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
SPN:22:003:V	On the counter was a cardboard box
SPN:22:004:V	And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
SPN:22:005:V	Black and white, saw a 30s bride
SPN:22:006:V	And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
SPN:22:007:V	The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
SPN:22:008:V	The kind you don't put down
SPN:22:009:C	And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
SPN:22:010:C	But in those photos, I saw us instead
SPN:22:011:C	And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
SPN:22:012:C	In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met
SPN:22:013:C	On a crowded street in 1944
SPN:22:014:C	And you were headed off to fight in the war
SPN:22:015:C	You still would've been mine
SPN:22:016:C	We would have been timeless
SPN:22:017:C	I would've read your love letters every single night
SPN:22:018:C	And prayed to god you'd be comin' home all right
SPN:22:019:C	And you would've been fine
SPN:22:020:C	We would have been timeless
SPN:22:021:C	'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
SPN:22:022:C	So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
SPN:22:023:C	We would've been timeless
SPN:22:024:V	I had to smile when it caught my eye
SPN:22:025:V	There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
SPN:22:026:V	Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
SPN:22:027:V	And the date on the back said 1958
SPN:22:028:V	Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
SPN:22:029:V	Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
SPN:22:030:V	I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
SPN:22:031:V	At these precious things that time forgot
SPN:22:032:C	That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
SPN:22:033:C	Story of a romance torn apart by fate
SPN:22:034:C	Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
SPN:22:035:C	And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
SPN:22:036:C	In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
SPN:22:037:C	And I was forced to marry another man
SPN:22:038:C	You still would've been mine
SPN:22:039:C	We would have been timeless
SPN:22:040:C	I would've read your love letters every single night
SPN:22:041:C	And run away and left it all behind
SPN:22:042:C	You still would've been mine
SPN:22:043:C	We would've been timeless
SPN:22:044:C	'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
SPN:22:045:C	So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
SPN:22:046:C	We would've been timeless
SPN:22:047:B	Time breaks down your mind and body
SPN:22:048:B	Don't you let it touch your soul
SPN:22:049:B	It was like an age-old classic
SPN:22:050:B	The first time that you saw me
SPN:22:051:B	The story started when you said, "Hello"
SPN:22:052:C	In a crowded room a few short years ago
SPN:22:053:C	And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
SPN:22:054:C	You're always gonna be mine
SPN:22:055:C	We're gonna be
SPN:22:056:C	I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
SPN:22:057:C	We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
SPN:22:058:C	And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
SPN:22:059:C	We're gonna be timeless, timeless
SPN:22:060:C	You still would've been mine
SPN:22:061:C	We would've been
SPN:22:062:C	Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
SPN:22:063:C	You still would've been mine
SPN:22:064:C	We would've been
SPN:22:065:I	Down the block, there's an antique shop
SPN:22:066:I	And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
RED:01:001:V	I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
RED:01:002:V	Busy streets and busy lives
RED:01:003:V	And all we know is touch and go
RED:01:004:V	We are alone with our changing minds
RED:01:005:V	We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
RED:01:006:C	And I never (I never)
RED:01:007:C	Saw you comin'
RED:01:008:C	And I'll never (I'll never)
RED:01:009:C	Be the same
RED:01:010:V	You come around and the armor falls
RED:01:011:V	Pierce the room like a cannonball
RED:01:012:V	Now all we know is don't let go
RED:01:013:V	We are alone, just you and me
RED:01:014:V	Up in your room and our slates are clean
RED:01:015:V	Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
RED:01:016:C	So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
RED:01:017:C	We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
RED:01:018:C	But this love is brave and wild
RED:01:019:C	And I never (I never)
RED:01:020:C	Saw you comin'
RED:01:021:C	And I'll never (I'll never)
RED:01:022:C	Be the same
RED:01:023:B	This is a state of grace
RED:01:024:B	This is the worthwhile fight
RED:01:025:B	Love is a ruthless game
RED:01:026:B	Unless you play it good and right
RED:01:027:B	These are the hands of fate
RED:01:028:B	You're my Achilles-heel
RED:01:029:B	This is the golden age of somethin' good
RED:01:030:B	And right and real
RED:01:031:C	And I never (I never)
RED:01:032:C	Saw you comin'
RED:01:033:C	And I'll never
RED:01:034:C	Be the same, oh-oh-oh
RED:01:035:C	And I never (I never)
RED:01:036:C	Saw you comin'
RED:01:037:C	And I'll never (I'll never)
RED:01:038:C	(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
RED:01:039:C	Be the same (We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
RED:01:040:C	(But this love is brave and wild)
RED:01:041:I	This is a state of grace
RED:01:042:I	This is the worthwhile fight
RED:01:043:I	Love is a ruthless game
RED:01:044:I	Unless you play it good and right
RED:02:001:V	Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
RED:02:002:V	Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
RED:02:003:V	Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
RED:02:004:V	Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
RED:02:005:C	Losing him was blue like I'd never known
RED:02:006:C	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
RED:02:007:C	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
RED:02:008:C	But loving him was red (Red, red)
RED:02:009:C	(Red, red)
RED:02:010:C	But loving him was red (Red, red)
RED:02:011:C	(Red, red)
RED:02:012:V	Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
RED:02:013:V	Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
RED:02:014:V	Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
RED:02:015:V	Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
RED:02:016:C	Losing him was blue like I'd never known
RED:02:017:C	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
RED:02:018:C	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
RED:02:019:C	But loving him was red (Red, red)
RED:02:020:C	Oh, red (Red, red)
RED:02:021:C	Burning red (Red, red)
RED:02:022:C	(Red, red)
RED:02:023:B	Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
RED:02:024:B	Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
RED:02:025:B	But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
RED:02:026:B	In burning red
RED:02:027:B	Burning, it was red
RED:02:028:C	Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
RED:02:029:C	Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
RED:02:030:C	Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
RED:02:031:C	'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
RED:02:032:C	Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
RED:02:033:C	Oh, burning red (Red, red)
RED:02:034:C	(Red, red)
RED:02:035:C	And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
RED:02:036:C	Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
RED:02:037:C	(Red, red)
RED:02:038:C	Yeah, yeah (Red, red)
RED:02:039:I	His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
RED:03:001:V	Put your lips close to mine
RED:03:002:V	As long as they don't touch
RED:03:003:V	Out of focus, eye to eye
RED:03:004:V	'Til the gravity's too much
RED:03:005:V	And I'll do anything you say
RED:03:006:V	If you say it with your hands
RED:03:007:V	And I'd be smart to walk away
RED:03:008:V	But you're quicksand
RED:03:009:C	This slope is treacherous
RED:03:010:C	This path is reckless
RED:03:011:C	This slope is treacherous
RED:03:012:C	And I-I-I like it
RED:03:013:V	I can't decide if it's a choice
RED:03:014:V	Getting swept away
RED:03:015:V	I hear the sound of my own voice
RED:03:016:V	Asking you to stay
RED:03:017:V	All we are is skin and bone
RED:03:018:V	Trained to get along
RED:03:019:V	Forever going with the flow
RED:03:020:V	But you're friction
RED:03:021:C	This slope is treacherous
RED:03:022:C	This path is reckless
RED:03:023:C	This slope is treacherous
RED:03:024:C	I-I-I like it
RED:03:025:B	Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
RED:03:026:B	And I will get you a— get you alone
RED:03:027:B	Your name has echoed through my mind
RED:03:028:B	And I just think you should— think you should know
RED:03:029:B	That nothing safe is worth the drive
RED:03:030:B	And I would follow you, follow you home
RED:03:031:B	I'll follow you, follow you home
RED:03:032:C	This hope is treacherous
RED:03:033:C	This daydream is dangerous
RED:03:034:C	This hope is treacherous
RED:03:035:C	I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—
RED:03:036:B	Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
RED:03:037:B	And I will get you a— get you alone
RED:03:038:B	Your name has echoed through my mind
RED:03:039:B	And I just think you should— think you should know
RED:03:040:B	That nothing safe is worth the drive
RED:03:041:B	And I will follow you, follow you home
RED:03:042:B	I'll follow you, follow you home
RED:03:043:B	I'll follow you, follow you home
RED:03:044:B	I'll follow you, follow you home
RED:03:045:I	This slope is treacherous
RED:03:046:I	I-I-I like it
RED:04:001:V	Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
RED:04:002:V	I was in your sights, you got me alone
RED:04:003:V	You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
RED:04:004:V	I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
RED:04:005:V	And when I fell hard, you took a step back
RED:04:006:V	Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-e
RED:04:007:C	And he's long gone when he's next to me
RED:04:008:C	And I realize the blame is on me
RED:04:009:C	'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:010:C	So shame on me now
RED:04:011:C	Flew me to places I'd never been
RED:04:012:C	'Til you put me down, oh
RED:04:013:C	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:014:C	So shame on me now
RED:04:015:C	Flew me to places I'd never been
RED:04:016:C	Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
RED:04:017:C	Oh, oh
RED:04:018:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble
RED:04:019:C	Oh, oh
RED:04:020:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble
RED:04:021:V	No apologies, he'll never see you cry
RED:04:022:V	Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
RED:04:023:V	You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
RED:04:024:V	And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
RED:04:025:V	A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
RED:04:026:V	And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-e
RED:04:027:C	He was long gone when he met me
RED:04:028:C	And I realize the joke is on me, hey
RED:04:029:C	I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
RED:04:030:C	So shame on me now
RED:04:031:C	Flew me to places I'd never been
RED:04:032:C	'Til you put me down, oh
RED:04:033:C	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:034:C	So shame on me now
RED:04:035:C	Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
RED:04:036:C	Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
RED:04:037:C	Oh, oh (Yeah)
RED:04:038:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
RED:04:039:C	Oh, oh
RED:04:040:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble
RED:04:041:B	And the saddest fear
RED:04:042:B	Comes creepin' in
RED:04:043:B	That you never loved me
RED:04:044:B	Or her or anyone or anything, yeah
RED:04:045:C	I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:046:C	So shame on me now
RED:04:047:C	Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
RED:04:048:C	'Til you put me down, oh
RED:04:049:C	I knew you were trouble when you walked in (I knew it right there)
RED:04:050:C	So shame on me now (I knew it right there)
RED:04:051:C	Flew me to places I'd never been (Woah)
RED:04:052:C	Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
RED:04:053:C	Oh, oh
RED:04:054:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
RED:04:055:C	Oh, oh
RED:04:056:C	Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
RED:04:057:I	'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:058:I	Trouble, trouble, trouble
RED:04:059:I	'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
RED:04:060:I	Trouble, trouble, trouble
RED:06:001:V	It feels like a perfect night
RED:06:002:V	To dress up like hipsters
RED:06:003:V	And make fun of our exes
RED:06:004:V	Uh-uh, uh-uh
RED:06:005:V	It feels like a perfect night
RED:06:006:V	For breakfast at midnight
RED:06:007:V	To fall in love with strangers
RED:06:008:V	Uh-uh, uh-uh
RED:06:009:C	Yeah
RED:06:010:C	We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
RED:06:011:C	It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
RED:06:012:C	Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
RED:06:013:C	It's time, oh-oh
RED:06:014:C	I don't know about you
RED:06:015:C	But I'm feelin' twenty-two
RED:06:016:C	Everything will be alright if
RED:06:017:C	You keep me next to you
RED:06:018:C	You don't know about me
RED:06:019:C	But I'll bet you want to
RED:06:020:C	Everything will be alright if
RED:06:021:C	We just keep dancin' like we're
RED:06:022:C	Twenty-two
RED:06:023:C	Twenty-two
RED:06:024:V	It seems like one of those nights
RED:06:025:V	This place is too crowded
RED:06:026:V	Too many cool kids
RED:06:027:V	Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor-Swift anyway? Ew)
RED:06:028:V	It seems like one of those nights
RED:06:029:V	We ditch the whole scene
RED:06:030:V	And end up dreamin'
RED:06:031:V	Instead of sleepin'
RED:06:032:C	Yeah
RED:06:033:C	We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
RED:06:034:C	It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
RED:06:035:C	Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
RED:06:036:C	It's time, oh-oh
RED:06:037:C	(Hey)
RED:06:038:C	I don't know about you
RED:06:039:C	But I'm feelin' twenty-two

RED:06:042:C	You don't know about me
RED:06:043:C	But I'll bet you want to
RED:06:044:C	Everything will be alright if (Alright)
RED:06:045:C	We just keep dancin' like we're
RED:06:046:C	Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
RED:06:047:C	Twenty-two (I don't know about you)
RED:06:048:C	Twenty-two
RED:06:049:C	Twenty-two (Ooh)
RED:06:050:C	It feels like one of those nights
RED:06:051:C	We ditch the whole scene
RED:06:052:C	It feels like one of those nights
RED:06:053:C	We won't be sleepin'
RED:06:054:C	It feels like one of those nights
RED:06:055:C	You look like bad news
RED:06:056:C	I gotta have you
RED:06:057:C	I gotta have you
RED:06:058:B	Ooh, oh
RED:06:059:B	Yeah, hey, yeah

RED:06:063:C	Everything will be alright if (Ooh, oh-oh)
RED:06:064:C	You keep me next to you
RED:06:065:C	You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
RED:06:066:C	But I'll bet you want to
RED:06:067:C	Everything will be alright if
RED:06:068:C	We just keep dancin' like we're (Dance like we're twenty-two)
RED:06:069:C	Twenty-two (Ooh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
RED:06:070:C	Twenty-two (Dancin' like)
RED:06:071:C	Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah)
RED:06:072:C	Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
RED:06:073:C	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
RED:06:074:C	We ditch the whole scene
RED:06:075:C	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
RED:06:076:C	We won't be sleepin'
RED:06:077:C	It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
RED:06:078:C	You look like bad news
RED:06:079:C	I gotta have you
RED:06:080:C	I gotta have you
RED:07:001:V	I bet, this time of night, you're still up
RED:07:002:V	I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
RED:07:003:V	I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
RED:07:004:V	And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me
RED:07:005:C	And I just wanna tell you
RED:07:006:C	It takes everything in me not to call you
RED:07:007:C	And I wish I could run to you
RED:07:008:C	And I hope you know that
RED:07:009:C	Every time I don't, I almost do
RED:07:010:C	I almost do
RED:07:011:V	I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
RED:07:012:V	'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
RED:07:013:V	I bet it never, ever occurred to you
RED:07:014:V	That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye
RED:07:015:C	And I just wanna tell you
RED:07:016:C	It takes everything in me not to call you
RED:07:017:C	And I wish I could run to you
RED:07:018:C	And I hope you know that
RED:07:019:C	Every time I don't, I almost do
RED:07:020:C	I almost do
RED:07:021:C	(Ooh)
RED:07:022:B	Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
RED:07:023:B	It's probably better off this way
RED:07:024:B	And I confess, babe
RED:07:025:B	In my dreams, you're touchin' my face
RED:07:026:B	And asking me if I'd wanna try again with you
RED:07:027:B	And I almost do
RED:07:028:C	And I just wanna tell you
RED:07:029:C	It takes everything in me not to call you
RED:07:030:C	And I wish I could run to you
RED:07:031:C	And I hope you know that
RED:07:032:C	Every time I don't, I almost do
RED:07:033:C	I almost do
RED:07:034:C	(Ooh)
RED:07:035:I	I bet, this time of night, you're still up
RED:07:036:I	I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
RED:07:037:I	I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
RED:07:038:I	And I hope sometimes you wonder 'bout me
RED:08:001:V	I remember when we broke up the first time
RED:08:002:V	Sayin', "This is it, I've had enough"
RED:08:003:V	'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
RED:08:004:V	When you said you needed space, what?
RED:08:005:V	Then you come around again and say
RED:08:006:V	"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
RED:08:007:V	Remember how that lasted for a day?
RED:08:008:V	I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
RED:08:009:C	Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
RED:08:010:C	Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you
RED:08:011:C	We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:012:C	We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:013:C	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
RED:08:014:C	But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:015:C	Like, ever
RED:08:016:V	I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
RED:08:017:V	And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
RED:08:018:V	And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
RED:08:019:V	With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (ha-ha)
RED:08:020:C	Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but
RED:08:021:C	Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)
RED:08:022:C	We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:023:C	We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together
RED:08:024:C	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
RED:08:025:C	But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:026:C	Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)
RED:08:027:C	Ooh (Yeah), oh
RED:08:028:B	I used to think that we were forever, ever
RED:08:029:B	And I used to say, "Never say never"
RED:08:030:B	Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, "I still love you"
RED:08:031:B	And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
RED:08:032:B	Like, we are never getting back together
RED:08:033:B	Like, ever (No)
RED:08:034:C	We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:035:C	We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together
RED:08:036:C	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)
RED:08:037:C	But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:08:038:I	We (Ooh), no
RED:08:039:I	Gettin' back together (Ooh)
RED:08:040:I	We (Ooh), oh
RED:08:041:I	Gettin' back together (Ooh), yeah
RED:08:042:I	You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
RED:08:043:I	But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
RED:09:001:V	I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
RED:09:002:V	I threw my phone across the room at you
RED:09:003:V	I was expecting some dramatic turn away
RED:09:004:V	But you stayed
RED:09:005:V	This morning, I said we should talk about it
RED:09:006:V	'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
RED:09:007:V	That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
RED:09:008:V	And said, "Okay, let's talk"
RED:09:009:C	And I said, "Stay, stay, stay"
RED:09:010:C	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
RED:09:011:C	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
RED:09:012:C	But I think that it's best if we both stay
RED:09:013:V	Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
RED:09:014:V	Who took all of their problems out on me
RED:09:015:V	But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
RED:09:016:V	And I love you because you have given me
RED:09:017:C	No choice but to stay, stay, stay
RED:09:018:C	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
RED:09:019:C	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
RED:09:020:C	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
RED:09:021:B	You took the time to memorize me
RED:09:022:B	My fears, my hopes and dreams
RED:09:023:B	I just like hanging out with you
RED:09:024:B	All the time
RED:09:025:B	All those times that you didn't leave
RED:09:026:B	It's been occurring to me
RED:09:027:B	I'd like to hang out with you
RED:09:028:B	For my whole life
RED:09:029:C	Stay
RED:09:030:C	And I'll be loving you for quite some time
RED:09:031:C	No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
RED:09:032:C	So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
RED:09:033:C	Stay, stay, stay
RED:09:034:C	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
RED:09:035:C	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
RED:09:036:C	But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
RED:09:037:C	Stay, stay, stay
RED:09:038:C	I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
RED:09:039:C	You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
RED:09:040:C	But I think that it's best if we both stay
RED:09:041:I	That's so fun
RED:10:001:V	I find myself at your door
RED:10:002:V	Just like all those times before
RED:10:003:V	I'm not sure how I got there
RED:10:004:V	All roads, they lead me here
RED:10:005:V	I imagine you are home
RED:10:006:V	In your room, all alone
RED:10:007:V	And you open your eyes into mine
RED:10:008:V	And everything feels better
RED:10:009:C	And right before your eyes
RED:10:010:C	I'm breakin'
RED:10:011:C	No past, no reasons why
RED:10:012:C	Just you and me
RED:10:013:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:014:C	Put my name at the top of your list
RED:10:015:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you why
RED:10:016:C	You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
RED:10:017:V	You find yourself at my door
RED:10:018:V	And just like all those times before
RED:10:019:V	You wear your best apology
RED:10:020:V	But I was there to watch you leave
RED:10:021:V	And all the times I let you in
RED:10:022:V	Just for you to go again
RED:10:023:V	Disappear when you come back
RED:10:024:V	Everything is better
RED:10:025:C	And right before your eyes
RED:10:026:C	I'm achin'
RED:10:027:C	No past, nowhere to hide
RED:10:028:C	Just you and me
RED:10:029:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:030:C	Put my name at the top of your list
RED:10:031:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you why
RED:10:032:C	You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
RED:10:033:B	This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
RED:10:034:B	This is the last time I say, "It's been you all along"
RED:10:035:B	This is the last time I let you in my door
RED:10:036:B	This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
RED:10:037:B	Oh, oh, oh, oh
RED:10:038:B	Oh, oh, oh, oh
RED:10:039:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:040:C	Put my name at the top of your list
RED:10:041:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you why
RED:10:042:C	You break my heart in the blink of an eye
RED:10:043:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you this (This is the last time I'm askin' you this)
RED:10:044:C	Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
RED:10:045:C	This is the last time I'm askin' you why (This is the last time I'm askin' you why)
RED:10:046:C	You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)
RED:10:047:I	This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
RED:10:048:I	Last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:049:I	This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
RED:10:050:I	Last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:051:I	This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
RED:10:052:I	Last time I'm askin' you this
RED:10:053:I	This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
RED:10:054:I	Last time I'm askin' you this
RED:11:001:V	I was reminiscing just the other day
RED:11:002:V	While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
RED:11:003:V	Back to a first-glance feelin' on New-York time
RED:11:004:V	Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
RED:11:005:V	Took off faster than a green light, go
RED:11:006:V	Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
RED:11:007:V	I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
RED:11:008:V	And that was the first day
RED:11:009:C	And darlin', it was good
RED:11:010:C	Never lookin' down
RED:11:011:C	And right there where we stood
RED:11:012:C	Was holy ground
RED:11:013:V	Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
RED:11:014:V	We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
RED:11:015:V	We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
RED:11:016:V	And for the first time, I had something to lose
RED:11:017:V	And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
RED:11:018:V	And the story's got dust on every page
RED:11:019:V	But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
RED:11:020:V	And I see your face in every crowd
RED:11:021:C	'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:022:C	Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:023:C	And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
RED:11:024:C	Was holy ground
RED:11:025:C	Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
RED:11:026:C	Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
RED:11:027:B	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
RED:11:028:B	For all that we've been through
RED:11:029:B	But I don't wanna dance
RED:11:030:B	If I'm not dancin' with you
RED:11:031:B	Tonight, I'm gonna dance
RED:11:032:B	Like you were in this room
RED:11:033:B	But I don't wanna dance
RED:11:034:B	If I'm not dancin' with you
RED:11:035:C	It was good
RED:11:036:C	I'm never lookin' down
RED:11:037:C	And right there where we stood
RED:11:038:C	Was holy ground
RED:11:039:C	Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
RED:11:040:C	Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
RED:11:041:I	Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:042:I	For all that we've been through (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
RED:11:043:I	But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:044:I	If I'm not dancin' with you (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
RED:11:045:I	Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:046:I	Like you were in this room (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
RED:11:047:I	But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
RED:11:048:I	If I'm not dancin' with you
RED:12:001:V	Long handwritten notes deep in your pocket
RED:12:002:V	Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
RED:12:003:V	I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
RED:12:004:V	Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
RED:12:005:C	We had a beautiful, magic love there
RED:12:006:C	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
RED:12:007:V	In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
RED:12:008:V	And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
RED:12:009:V	And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
RED:12:010:V	And you've got your demons and, darlin', they all look like me
RED:12:011:C	'Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there
RED:12:012:C	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
RED:12:013:C	Woah, woah, woah, oh
RED:12:014:B	Distance, timin', breakdown, fighting
RED:12:015:B	Silence, the train runs off its tracks
RED:12:016:B	Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
RED:12:017:B	Hang up, give up and, for the life of us, we can't get back
RED:12:018:C	A beautiful, magic love there
RED:12:019:C	What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
RED:12:020:C	What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
RED:12:021:C	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
RED:12:022:C	We had a beautiful, magic love there
RED:12:023:C	What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
RED:13:001:V	New to town with a made-up name
RED:13:002:V	In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
RED:13:003:V	And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
RED:13:004:V	You had it figured out since you were in school
RED:13:005:V	Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
RED:13:006:V	So overnight, you look like a '60s queen
RED:13:007:C	Another name goes up in lights
RED:13:008:C	Like diamonds in the sky
RED:13:009:C	And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:010:C	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:011:C	But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
RED:13:012:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:13:013:V	And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
RED:13:014:V	And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
RED:13:015:V	And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
RED:13:016:V	And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
RED:13:017:V	'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
RED:13:018:V	And all the young things line up to take your place
RED:13:019:C	Another name goes up in lights
RED:13:020:C	You wonder if you'll make it out alive
RED:13:021:C	And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:022:C	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:023:C	Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
RED:13:024:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:13:025:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:13:026:V	It was a few years later, I showed up here
RED:13:027:V	And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
RED:13:028:V	How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
RED:13:029:V	They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
RED:13:030:V	Chose the rose garden over Madison-Square
RED:13:031:V	And it took some time, but I understand it now
RED:13:032:C	'Cause now my name is up in lights
RED:13:033:C	But I think you got it right
RED:13:034:C	Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:035:C	Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:036:C	Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:037:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:13:038:C	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:039:C	Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:040:C	Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
RED:13:041:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:13:042:C	Oh, oh-woah, oh
RED:14:001:I	You good to go?
RED:14:002:V	All I knew this mornin' when I woke
RED:14:003:V	Is I know something now
RED:14:004:V	Know something now I didn't before
RED:14:005:V	And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
RED:14:006:V	Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
RED:14:007:V	In the back of my mind makin' me feel like
RED:14:008:C	I just wanna know you better
RED:14:009:C	Know you better, know you better now
RED:14:010:C	I just wanna know you better
RED:14:011:C	Know you better, know you better now
RED:14:012:C	I just wanna know you better
RED:14:013:C	Know you better, know you better now
RED:14:014:C	I just wanna know you
RED:14:015:C	Know you, know you
RED:14:016:C	'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
RED:14:017:C	And your eyes look like comin' home
RED:14:018:C	All I know is a simple name
RED:14:019:C	Everything has changed
RED:14:020:C	All I know is you held the door
RED:14:021:C	You'll be mine and I'll be yours
RED:14:022:C	All I know since yesterday, yeah
RED:14:023:C	Is everything has changed
RED:14:024:V	And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
RED:14:025:V	But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
RED:14:026:V	And open up the door for you
RED:14:027:V	And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
RED:14:028:V	The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
RED:14:029:V	Takin' flight, makin' me feel like
RED:14:030:C	I just wanna know you better

RED:14:038:C	'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
RED:14:039:C	And your eyes look like comin' home
RED:14:040:C	All I know is a simple name
RED:14:041:C	Everything has changed
RED:14:042:C	All I know is you held the door
RED:14:043:C	You'll be mine and I'll be yours

RED:14:049:B	And let me know that it's not all in my mind-ind-ind
RED:14:050:C	I just wanna know you better

RED:14:052:C	I just wanna know you
RED:14:053:C	Know you, know you
RED:14:054:C	All I know is we said, "Hello"
RED:14:055:C	And your eyes look like comin' home
RED:14:056:C	All I know is a simple name
RED:14:057:C	Everything has changed
RED:14:058:C	All I know is you held the door
RED:14:059:C	And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
RED:14:060:C	All I know since yesterday, yeah
RED:14:061:C	Is everything has changed
RED:14:062:I	All I know is we said, "Hello"
RED:14:063:I	So dust off your highest hopes
RED:14:064:I	All I know is pourin' rain
RED:14:065:I	And everything has changed
RED:14:066:I	All I know is a new found grace
RED:14:067:I	All my days, I'll know your face
RED:14:068:I	All I know since yesterday, yeah
RED:14:069:I	Is everything has changed
RED:15:001:C	I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
RED:15:002:C	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
RED:15:003:C	The whole place was dressed to the nines
RED:15:004:C	And we were dancin', dancin'
RED:15:005:C	Like we're made of starlight
RED:15:006:C	Like we're made of starlight
RED:15:007:V	I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
RED:15:008:V	Picks me up late one night, out the window
RED:15:009:V	We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
RED:15:010:V	Can't remember what song it was playin' when we walked in
RED:15:011:V	The night we snuck into a yacht club party
RED:15:012:V	Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince
RED:15:013:C	And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
RED:15:014:C	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
RED:15:015:C	The whole place was dressed to the nines
RED:15:016:C	And we were dancin', dancin'
RED:15:017:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:018:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:019:V	He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change"
RED:15:020:V	"You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way"
RED:15:021:V	He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
RED:15:022:V	"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
RED:15:023:V	"Don't you dream impossible things?"
RED:15:024:C	Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
RED:15:025:C	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
RED:15:026:C	The whole place was dressed to the nines
RED:15:027:C	And we were dancin', dancin'
RED:15:028:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:029:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:030:B	Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
RED:15:031:B	Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
RED:15:032:B	Ooh, ooh, we could get married
RED:15:033:B	Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
RED:15:034:C	(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
RED:15:035:C	(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
RED:15:036:C	(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
RED:15:037:C	(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
RED:15:038:C	Oh my, what a marvelous tune
RED:15:039:C	It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
RED:15:040:C	The whole place was dressed to the nines
RED:15:041:C	And we were dancin', dancin'
RED:15:042:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:043:C	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:044:I	Like we're made of starlight, starlight
RED:15:045:I	Like we dream impossible dreams
RED:15:046:I	Like starlight, starlight
RED:15:047:I	Like we dream impossible dreams
RED:15:048:I	Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
RED:15:049:I	Don't you dream impossible things?
RED:16:001:V	Took a deep breath in the mirror
RED:16:002:V	He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
RED:16:003:V	Turn the lock and put my headphones on
RED:16:004:V	He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do
RED:16:005:V	I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
RED:16:006:V	But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you
RED:16:007:V	You pull my chair out and help me in
RED:16:008:V	And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
RED:16:009:C	And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
RED:16:010:C	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
RED:16:011:C	I've been spendin' the last eight months
RED:16:012:C	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
RED:16:013:C	But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
RED:16:014:V	You said you never met one girl who
RED:16:015:V	Had as many James-Taylor records as you, but I do
RED:16:016:V	We tell stories and you don't know why
RED:16:017:V	I'm comin' off a little shy, but I do
RED:16:018:C	But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
RED:16:019:C	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
RED:16:020:C	I've been spendin' the last eight months
RED:16:021:C	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
RED:16:022:C	But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
RED:16:023:B	And we walked down the block to my car
RED:16:024:B	And I almost brought him up
RED:16:025:B	But you start to talk about the movies
RED:16:026:B	That your family watches every single Christmas
RED:16:027:B	And I wanna talk about that
RED:16:028:B	And for the first time, what's past is past
RED:16:029:C	'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
RED:16:030:C	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
RED:16:031:C	I've been spendin' the last eight months
RED:16:032:C	Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
RED:16:033:C	But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
RED:16:034:I	On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
RED:17:001:V	You should've been there
RED:17:002:V	Should've burst through the door
RED:17:003:V	With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
RED:17:004:V	And it would've felt like
RED:17:005:V	A million little shining stars that just align
RED:17:006:V	And I would've been so happy
RED:17:007:V	Christmas lights glisten
RED:17:008:V	I've got my eye on the door
RED:17:009:V	Just waitin' for you to walk in
RED:17:010:V	But the time is tickin'
RED:17:011:V	People ask me how I've been
RED:17:012:V	As I comb back through my memory
RED:17:013:V	How you said you'd be here
RED:17:014:V	You said you'd be here
RED:17:015:C	And it was like slow motion
RED:17:016:C	Standing there in my party dress
RED:17:017:C	In red lipstick
RED:17:018:C	With no one to impress
RED:17:019:C	And they're all laughin'
RED:17:020:C	As I'm lookin' around the room
RED:17:021:C	But there was one thing missin'
RED:17:022:C	And that was the moment I knew
RED:17:023:V	And the hours pass by
RED:17:024:V	Now I just wanna be alone
RED:17:025:V	But your close friends always seem to know
RED:17:026:V	When there's somethin' really wrong
RED:17:027:V	So they follow me down the hall
RED:17:028:V	And there in the bathroom
RED:17:029:V	I try not to fall apart
RED:17:030:V	And the sinking feelin' starts
RED:17:031:V	As I say hopelessly
RED:17:032:V	"He said he'd be here"
RED:17:033:C	And it was like slow motion
RED:17:034:C	Standing there in my party dress
RED:17:035:C	In red lipstick
RED:17:036:C	With no one to impress
RED:17:037:C	And they're all laughin'
RED:17:038:C	And asking me about you
RED:17:039:C	But there was one thing missin'
RED:17:040:C	And that was the moment I knew
RED:17:041:B	What do you say
RED:17:042:B	When tears are streaming down your face
RED:17:043:B	In front of everyone you know?
RED:17:044:B	And what do you do
RED:17:045:B	When the one who means the most to you
RED:17:046:B	Is the one who didn't show?
RED:17:047:B	You should've been here
RED:17:048:B	And I would've been so happy
RED:17:049:C	And it was like slow motion
RED:17:050:C	Standing there in my party dress
RED:17:051:C	In red lipstick
RED:17:052:C	With no one to impress
RED:17:053:C	And they're all standin' around me, singin'
RED:17:054:C	"Happy birthday to you"
RED:17:055:C	But there was one thing missin'
RED:17:056:C	And that was the moment I knew
RED:17:057:C	(Oh) Oh, I knew
RED:17:058:C	(Oh)
RED:17:059:I	You called me later
RED:17:060:I	And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
RED:17:061:I	And I said, "I'm sorry too"
RED:17:062:I	And that was the moment I knew
RED:18:001:V	You said it in a simple way
RED:18:002:V	4AM, the second day
RED:18:003:V	How strange that I don't know you at all
RED:18:004:V	Stumbled through the long goodbye
RED:18:005:V	One last kiss, then catch your flight
RED:18:006:V	Right when I was just about to fall
RED:18:007:C	I told myself, "Don't get attached"
RED:18:008:C	But in my mind, I play it back
RED:18:009:C	Spinning faster than the plane that took you
RED:18:010:C	And this is when the feelin' sinks in
RED:18:011:C	I don't wanna miss you like this
RED:18:012:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:013:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:014:C	I guess you're in New-York today
RED:18:015:C	I don't wanna need you this way
RED:18:016:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:017:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:018:V	The delicate beginnin' rush
RED:18:019:V	The feelin' you can know so much
RED:18:020:V	Without knowing anything at all
RED:18:021:V	And now that I can put this down
RED:18:022:V	If I had known what I know now
RED:18:023:V	I never would've played so nonchalant
RED:18:024:C	Taxi cabs and busy streets
RED:18:025:C	That never bring you back to me
RED:18:026:C	I can't help but wish you took me with you
RED:18:027:C	And this is when the feelin' sinks in
RED:18:028:C	I don't wanna miss you like this
RED:18:029:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:030:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:031:C	I guess you're in London today
RED:18:032:C	And I don't wanna need you this way
RED:18:033:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:034:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:035:C	Oh, oh
RED:18:036:C	Oh, oh
RED:18:037:C	Oh, oh
RED:18:038:B	This is falling in love in the cruelest way
RED:18:039:B	This is fallin' for you when you are worlds away
RED:18:040:B	In New-York, be here
RED:18:041:B	But you're in London and I break down
RED:18:042:B	'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
RED:18:043:C	This is when the feelin' sinks in
RED:18:044:C	I don't wanna miss you like this
RED:18:045:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:046:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:047:C	I guess you're in New-York today
RED:18:048:C	And I don't wanna need you this way
RED:18:049:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:050:C	Come back, be here
RED:18:051:C	Oh, oh
RED:18:052:C	I don't wanna miss you like this
RED:18:053:C	Oh, oh
RED:18:054:I	Come back, be here
RED:18:055:I	Come back, be here
RED:19:001:I	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:002:I	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
RED:19:003:I	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:004:I	And everybody knows that
RED:19:005:V	I don't even know her
RED:19:006:V	But I feel a responsibility
RED:19:007:V	To do what's upstanding and right
RED:19:008:V	It's kinda like a code, yeah
RED:19:009:V	And you've been getting closer and closer
RED:19:010:V	And crossing so many lines
RED:19:011:C	And it would be a fine proposition
RED:19:012:C	If I was a stupid girl
RED:19:013:C	But, honey, I am no one's exception
RED:19:014:C	This, I have previously learned
RED:19:015:C	So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:016:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
RED:19:017:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:018:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:019:C	I see you turn off your phone
RED:19:020:C	And now you've got me alone, and I say
RED:19:021:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:022:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:023:V	I just wanna make sure
RED:19:024:V	You understand perfectly
RED:19:025:V	You're the kind of man who makes me sad
RED:19:026:V	While she waits up
RED:19:027:V	You chase down the newest thing
RED:19:028:V	And take for granted what you have
RED:19:029:C	And it would be a fine proposition
RED:19:030:C	If I was a stupid girl
RED:19:031:C	And, yeah, I might go with it
RED:19:032:C	If I hadn't once been just like her
RED:19:033:C	So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:034:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
RED:19:035:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:036:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:037:C	I see you turn off your phone
RED:19:038:C	And now you've got me alone, and I say
RED:19:039:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:040:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:041:C	Oh-oh
RED:19:042:C	Oh-oh
RED:19:043:B	Call a cab, lose my number
RED:19:044:B	You're about to lose your girl
RED:19:045:B	Call a cab, lose my number
RED:19:046:B	Let's consider this lesson learned
RED:19:047:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:048:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
RED:19:049:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:050:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:051:C	Wanna see you pick up your phone
RED:19:052:C	And tell her you're coming home
RED:19:053:C	Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
RED:19:054:C	And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
RED:19:055:I	It would be a fine proposition
RED:19:056:I	If I hadn't once been just like her
RED:21:001:V	I remember your bare feet down the hallway
RED:21:002:V	I remember your little laugh
RED:21:003:V	Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
RED:21:004:V	I love you to the moon and back
RED:21:005:V	I remember your blue eyes lookin' into mine
RED:21:006:V	Like we had our own secret club
RED:21:007:V	I remember you dancin' before bedtime
RED:21:008:V	Then jumpin' on me, waking me up
RED:21:009:V	I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
RED:21:010:V	And even the moment I knew
RED:21:011:V	You fought it hard like an army guy
RED:21:012:V	Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
RED:21:013:C	"Come on, baby, with me
RED:21:014:C	We're gonna fly away from here
RED:21:015:C	You were my best four years"
RED:21:016:V	I remember the drive home when the blind hope
RED:21:017:V	Turned to cryin' and screamin', "Why?"
RED:21:018:V	Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
RED:21:019:V	About a beautiful boy who died
RED:21:020:V	And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
RED:21:021:V	You wanted if you were still here
RED:21:022:V	I remember the last day when I kissed your face
RED:21:023:V	And whispered in your ear
RED:21:024:C	"Come on, baby, with me
RED:21:025:C	We're gonna fly away from here
RED:21:026:C	Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
RED:21:027:C	We'll just disappear
RED:21:028:C	Come on, baby, with me
RED:21:029:C	We're gonna fly away from here
RED:21:030:C	You were my best four years"
RED:21:031:B	What if I'm standin' in your closet trying to talk to you?
RED:21:032:B	And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
RED:21:033:B	And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
RED:21:034:B	And what if the miracle was even gettin' one moment with you?
RED:21:035:C	Come on, baby, with me
RED:21:036:C	We're gonna fly away from here
RED:21:037:C	Come on, baby, with me
RED:21:038:C	We're gonna fly away from here
RED:21:039:C	You were my best four years
RED:21:040:I	I remember your bare feet down the hallway
RED:21:041:I	I love you to the moon and back
RED:22:001:V	I know I'm probably better off on my own
RED:22:002:V	Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
RED:22:003:V	And I see the permanent damage you did to me
RED:22:004:V	Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
RED:22:005:C	I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin' in the mirror
RED:22:006:C	Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
RED:22:007:C	I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
RED:22:008:C	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
RED:22:009:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:010:C	I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
RED:22:011:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:012:C	A better man
RED:22:013:V	I know I'm probably better off all alone
RED:22:014:V	Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
RED:22:015:V	And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
RED:22:016:V	Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning
RED:22:017:C	But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
RED:22:018:C	Talking down to me like I'd always be around
RED:22:019:C	Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
RED:22:020:C	Oh, you never thought I'd run
RED:22:021:C	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
RED:22:022:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:023:C	I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
RED:22:024:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:025:C	A better man
RED:22:026:B	I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
RED:22:027:B	And I gave to you my best
RED:22:028:B	And we both know you can't say that
RED:22:029:B	I wish you were a better man
RED:22:030:B	I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
RED:22:031:B	We might still be in love if you were a better man
RED:22:032:B	You would've been the one if you were a better man
RED:22:033:C	Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
RED:22:034:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:035:C	I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
RED:22:036:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:037:C	A better man
RED:22:038:C	(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
RED:22:039:C	We might still be in love, if you were a better man
RED:22:040:C	(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
RED:22:041:C	I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
RED:22:042:C	But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
RED:22:043:C	A better man
RED:22:044:I	We might still be in love if you were a better man
RED:22:045:I	You would've been the one if you were a better man
RED:23:001:V	They tell you while you're young
RED:23:002:V	"Girls, go out and have your fun"
RED:23:003:V	Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
RED:23:004:V	Criticize the way you fly
RED:23:005:V	When you're soaring through the sky
RED:23:006:V	Shoot you down and then they sigh
RED:23:007:V	And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
RED:23:008:C	Lord, what will become of me
RED:23:009:C	Once I've lost my novelty?
RED:23:010:C	I've had too much to drink tonight
RED:23:011:C	And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
RED:23:012:C	And I wake up in the middle of the night
RED:23:013:C	It's like I can feel time moving
RED:23:014:C	How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
RED:23:015:C	But nothin' at twenty-two?
RED:23:016:C	And will you still want me
RED:23:017:C	When I'm nothing new?
RED:23:018:V	How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
RED:23:019:V	When you can't blame it on my youth
RED:23:020:V	And roll your eyes with affection
RED:23:021:V	And my cheeks are growing tired
RED:23:022:V	From turning red and faking smiles
RED:23:023:V	Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?
RED:23:024:C	And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
RED:23:025:C	People love an ingénue (Ah)
RED:23:026:C	I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
RED:23:027:C	How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
RED:23:028:C	And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
RED:23:029:C	It's like I can feel time movin'
RED:23:030:C	How can a person know everything at eighteen
RED:23:031:C	But nothing at twenty-two?
RED:23:032:C	And will you still want me
RED:23:033:C	When I'm nothing new?
RED:23:034:B	I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
RED:23:035:B	The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
RED:23:036:B	She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
RED:23:037:B	I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
RED:23:038:B	Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
RED:23:039:B	Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)
RED:23:040:C	I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
RED:23:041:C	But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
RED:23:042:C	I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
RED:23:043:C	And I can feel time moving
RED:23:044:C	How can a person know everything at eighteen
RED:23:045:C	But nothing at twenty-two?
RED:23:046:C	And will you still want me
RED:23:047:C	Will you still want me
RED:23:048:C	Will you still want me
RED:23:049:C	When I'm nothing new?
RED:24:001:I	What about your promises, promises?
RED:24:002:I	What about your promises, promises, promises? No
RED:24:003:V	What a shame
RED:24:004:V	Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
RED:24:005:V	Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
RED:24:006:V	That you never should have made
RED:24:007:C	I'm here on the kitchen floor
RED:24:008:C	You call, but I won't hear it
RED:24:009:C	You said, "No one else"
RED:24:010:C	How could you do this, babe?
RED:24:011:C	(What about your promises, promises?)
RED:24:012:C	You really blew this, babe
RED:24:013:C	We ain't getting through this one, babe
RED:24:014:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
RED:24:015:C	(This is the last time, this is the last time)
RED:24:016:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
RED:24:017:C	(What about your promises, promises, promises? No)
RED:24:018:V	What a waste
RED:24:019:V	Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
RED:24:020:V	And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
RED:24:021:V	Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
RED:24:022:C	I break down every time you call
RED:24:023:C	We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
RED:24:024:C	We said, "No one else"
RED:24:025:C	How could you do this, babe?
RED:24:026:C	(Oh, what about your promises, promises?)
RED:24:027:C	You really blew this, babe
RED:24:028:C	We ain't getting through this one, babe
RED:24:029:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
RED:24:030:C	(This is the last time, this is the last time)
RED:24:031:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you
RED:24:032:B	Since you admitted it (Oh-oh), I keep picturin' (Oh-oh)
RED:24:033:B	Her lips on your neck (Oh-oh), I can't unsee it
RED:24:034:B	I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
RED:24:035:B	What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
RED:24:036:B	How could you do this, babe? (Babe)
RED:24:037:C	You really blew this, babe (Babe)
RED:24:038:C	We ain't getting through this one, babe (Babe)
RED:24:039:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
RED:24:040:C	(This is the last time, this is the last time)
RED:24:041:C	This is the last time I'll ever call you
RED:24:042:I	I'm here on the kitchen floor
RED:24:043:I	You call, but I won't hear it
RED:24:044:I	You said, "No one else"
RED:24:045:I	We ain't getting through this one, babe
RED:24:046:I	I break down every time you call
RED:24:047:I	We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
RED:24:048:I	We said, "No one else"
RED:24:049:I	This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
RED:24:050:I	(What about your promises, promises?)
RED:25:001:V	I know that you like me
RED:25:002:V	And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
RED:25:003:V	And I became hypnotized
RED:25:004:V	By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
RED:25:005:C	But now, you're so far away and I'm down
RED:25:006:C	Feelin' like a face in the crowd
RED:25:007:C	I'm reachin' for you, terrified
RED:25:008:C	'Cause you could be the one that I love
RED:25:009:C	I could be the one that you dream of
RED:25:010:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do
RED:25:011:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
RED:25:012:C	You could be the one that I keep, and I
RED:25:013:C	I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
RED:25:014:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do
RED:25:015:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
RED:25:016:V	These days I'm restless
RED:25:017:V	Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
RED:25:018:V	But time moves faster
RED:25:019:V	Replayin' your laughter, disaster
RED:25:020:C	'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
RED:25:021:C	Feelin' like a face in the crowd
RED:25:022:C	I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause
RED:25:023:C	'Cause you could be the one that I love
RED:25:024:C	I could be the one that you dream of
RED:25:025:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do
RED:25:026:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
RED:25:027:C	You could be the one that I keep, and I (Ah)
RED:25:028:C	I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At)
RED:25:029:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do
RED:25:030:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
RED:25:031:B	How is it in London? (London)
RED:25:032:B	Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
RED:25:033:B	If I'll ever see you again?
RED:25:034:B	You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
RED:25:035:B	And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
RED:25:036:C	'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)
RED:25:037:C	I could be the one that you dream of (Of)
RED:25:038:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do
RED:25:039:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
RED:25:040:C	You could be the one that I keep, and I
RED:25:041:C	I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (I can't sleep at night)
RED:25:042:C	A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)
RED:25:043:C	Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (Yeah, yeah)
RED:25:044:I	(Love) You could be the one that I love
RED:25:045:I	(Love) You could be the one that I love
RED:25:046:I	(Love) My love
RED:25:047:I	And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you
RED:26:001:V	3AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
RED:26:002:V	Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
RED:26:003:V	And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
RED:26:004:V	And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
RED:26:005:V	Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
RED:26:006:V	Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
RED:26:007:V	Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
RED:26:008:V	And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
RED:26:009:C	But now that we're done and it's over
RED:26:010:C	I bet you couldn't believe
RED:26:011:C	When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
RED:26:012:C	And I bet you think about me
RED:26:013:V	You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
RED:26:014:V	Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly-Hills
RED:26:015:V	I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
RED:26:016:V	Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
RED:26:017:V	But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
RED:26:018:V	And you and I fell like an early spring snow
RED:26:019:V	But reality crept in, you said we're too different
RED:26:020:V	You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
RED:26:021:C	Mr. Superior Thinkin'
RED:26:022:C	Do you have all the space that you need?
RED:26:023:C	I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
RED:26:024:C	And I bet you think about me
RED:26:025:C	I bet you think about me, yes
RED:26:026:C	I bet you think about me
RED:26:027:B	Oh, block it all out
RED:26:028:B	The voices so loud, sayin'
RED:26:029:B	"Why did you let her go?"
RED:26:030:B	Does it make you feel sad
RED:26:031:B	That the love that you're lookin' for
RED:26:032:B	Is the love that you had?
RED:26:033:V	Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
RED:26:034:V	Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
RED:26:035:V	Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
RED:26:036:V	Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
RED:26:037:C	But now that we're done and it's over
RED:26:038:C	I bet it's hard to believe
RED:26:039:C	But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
RED:26:040:C	And, yeah, I bet you think about me
RED:26:041:C	I bet you think about me, yes
RED:26:042:C	I bet you think about me
RED:26:043:I	I bet you think about me when you're out
RED:26:044:I	At your cool indie music concerts every week
RED:26:045:I	I bet you think about me in your house
RED:26:046:I	With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
RED:26:047:I	I bet you think about me when you say
RED:26:048:I	"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
RED:26:049:I	I bet you think about me
RED:27:001:V	He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
RED:27:002:V	He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
RED:27:003:V	He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
RED:27:004:V	He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
RED:27:005:C	I call, just checkin' up on him
RED:27:006:C	He's up, 3AM, pacin'
RED:27:007:C	He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
RED:27:008:C	My voice comes out beggin'
RED:27:009:C	All this time, I didn't know
RED:27:010:C	You were breakin' down
RED:27:011:C	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
RED:27:012:C	If you weren't around
RED:27:013:C	Too young to know it gets better
RED:27:014:C	I'll be summer sun for you forever
RED:27:015:C	Forever winter if you go
RED:27:016:V	He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
RED:27:017:V	His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
RED:27:018:V	I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
RED:27:019:V	Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
RED:27:020:C	I call, just checkin' up on him
RED:27:021:C	He's up, 5AM, wasted
RED:27:022:C	Long gone, not even listening
RED:27:023:C	My voice comes out screamin'
RED:27:024:C	All this time, I didn't know
RED:27:025:C	You were breakin' down
RED:27:026:C	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
RED:27:027:C	If you weren't around
RED:27:028:C	Too young to know it gets better
RED:27:029:C	I'll be summer sun for you forever
RED:27:030:C	Forever winter if you go
RED:27:031:B	If I was standing there in your apartment
RED:27:032:B	I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
RED:27:033:B	I'd say, "I love you even at your darkest and
RED:27:034:B	Please, don't go"
RED:27:035:C	I didn't know
RED:27:036:C	You were breakin' down
RED:27:037:C	I'd fall to pieces on the floor
RED:27:038:C	If you weren't around
RED:27:039:C	Too young to know it gets better
RED:27:040:C	I'll be summer sun for you forever
RED:27:041:C	Forever winter if you go
RED:27:042:C	(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
RED:27:043:C	I'll be your summer sun forever
RED:27:044:C	(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 3AM, pacin'
RED:27:045:C	All this time, I didn't know
RED:27:046:C	(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted
RED:27:047:C	I'd be in pieces on the floor
RED:27:048:C	Forever winter if you go
RED:27:049:I	He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
RED:27:050:I	I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"
RED:28:001:I	One, two, three, four
RED:28:002:V	Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
RED:28:003:V	We shouldn't be in this town
RED:28:004:V	And my so-called friends, they don't know
RED:28:005:V	I'd drive away before I let you go
RED:28:006:V	So give me a reason and don't say no, no
RED:28:007:C	There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
RED:28:008:C	"I'll wait for you"
RED:28:009:C	There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
RED:28:010:C	Take it with you
RED:28:011:C	And run like you'd run from the law
RED:28:012:C	Darling, let's run
RED:28:013:C	Run from it all
RED:28:014:C	We can go where our eyes can take us
RED:28:015:C	Go where no one else is, run
RED:28:016:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:017:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:018:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:019:V	So you laugh like a child
RED:28:020:V	And I'll sing like no one cares
RED:28:021:V	No one to be and no one to tell
RED:28:022:V	I could see this view a hundred times
RED:28:023:V	Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
RED:28:024:V	So give me a reason and don't say no, no
RED:28:025:C	And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
RED:28:026:C	Since I gave it to you
RED:28:027:C	There's a heart on your sleeve, I'll take it when I leave
RED:28:028:C	And hold it for you
RED:28:029:C	And run like you'd run from the law
RED:28:030:C	Darling, let's run
RED:28:031:C	Run from it all
RED:28:032:C	We can go like they're trying to chase us
RED:28:033:C	Go where no one else is, run
RED:28:034:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:035:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:036:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:037:B	There's been this hole in my heart
RED:28:038:B	This thing was a shot in the dark
RED:28:039:B	Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
RED:28:040:B	And I'll hold onto you while we run
RED:28:041:B	(And we run and we run and we run)
RED:28:042:C	Like you'd run from the law
RED:28:043:C	(And we run and we run and we run)
RED:28:044:C	Darling, let's run
RED:28:045:C	(And we run and we run and we run)
RED:28:046:C	Run from it all
RED:28:047:C	(And we run and we run and we run)
RED:28:048:C	We can go where our eyes can take us
RED:28:049:C	Go where no one else is, run
RED:28:050:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:051:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:052:C	Ooh, we'll run
RED:28:053:C	Ooh, and we'll run
RED:29:001:C	I wish I could fly
RED:29:002:C	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
RED:29:003:C	I'd write this in the sky
RED:29:004:C	I miss you like it was the very first night
RED:29:005:V	And so it goes
RED:29:006:V	Every weekend, this same party
RED:29:007:V	I never go alone
RED:29:008:V	And I don't seem broken-hearted
RED:29:009:V	My friends all say they know
RED:29:010:V	Everything I'm going through
RED:29:011:V	I drive down different roads
RED:29:012:V	But they all lead back to you
RED:29:013:C	'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
RED:29:014:C	They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
RED:29:015:C	Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
RED:29:016:C	They don't know how much I miss you
RED:29:017:C	I wish I could fly
RED:29:018:C	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
RED:29:019:C	I'd write this in the sky
RED:29:020:C	I miss you like it was the very first night
RED:29:021:V	And so it was
RED:29:022:V	We never saw it comin'
RED:29:023:V	Not trying to fall in love
RED:29:024:V	But we did like children runnin'
RED:29:025:V	Back then, we didn't know
RED:29:026:V	We were built to fall apart
RED:29:027:V	We broke the status-quo
RED:29:028:V	Then we broke each other's hearts
RED:29:029:C	But don't forget about the night out in L.A.
RED:29:030:C	Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
RED:29:031:C	No one knows about the words that we whispered
RED:29:032:C	No one knows how much I miss you
RED:29:033:C	I wish I could fly
RED:29:034:C	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
RED:29:035:C	I'd write this in the sky
RED:29:036:C	I miss you like it was the very first night
RED:29:037:C	Take me away, take me away
RED:29:038:C	Take me away to you, to you
RED:29:039:C	Take me away, take me away
RED:29:040:C	Take me away to you, to you
RED:29:041:B	I remember the night at the hotel
RED:29:042:B	I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
RED:29:043:B	I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
RED:29:044:B	"Do you know how much I miss you?"
RED:29:045:B	I wish that we could go back in time
RED:29:046:B	And I'd say to you
RED:29:047:B	"I miss you like it was the very first night"
RED:29:048:C	I wish I could fly
RED:29:049:C	I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
RED:29:050:C	I'd write this in the sky
RED:29:051:C	I miss you like it was the very first night
RED:29:052:C	Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
RED:29:053:C	Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
RED:29:054:C	Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
RED:29:055:C	Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
RED:30:001:V	I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
RED:30:002:V	But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
RED:30:003:V	And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
RED:30:004:V	And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
RED:30:005:V	Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
RED:30:006:V	We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
RED:30:007:V	Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
RED:30:008:V	And I can picture it after all these days
RED:30:009:C	And I know it's long gone and
RED:30:010:C	That magic's not here no more
RED:30:011:C	And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
RED:30:012:C	Oh, oh, oh
RED:30:013:C	'Cause there we are again on that little town street
RED:30:014:C	You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
RED:30:015:C	Wind in my hair, I was there
RED:30:016:C	I remember it all too well
RED:30:017:V	Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
RED:30:018:V	You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
RED:30:019:V	And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
RED:30:020:V	You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
RED:30:021:V	And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
RED:30:022:V	Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
RED:30:023:V	And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
RED:30:024:V	He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
RED:30:025:V	'Til we were dead and gone and buried
RED:30:026:V	Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
RED:30:027:V	After three months in the grave
RED:30:028:V	And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
RED:30:029:V	But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
RED:30:030:C	And I know it's long gone and
RED:30:031:C	There was nothing else I could do
RED:30:032:C	And I forget about you long enough
RED:30:033:C	To forget why I needed to
RED:30:034:C	'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
RED:30:035:C	We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
RED:30:036:C	Down the stairs, I was there
RED:30:037:C	I remember it all too well
RED:30:038:C	And there we are again when nobody had to know
RED:30:039:C	You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
RED:30:040:C	Sacred prayer and we'd swear
RED:30:041:C	To remember it all too well, yeah
RED:30:042:B	Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
RED:30:043:B	But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
RED:30:044:B	Runnin' scared, I was there
RED:30:045:B	I remember it all too well
RED:30:046:B	And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
RED:30:047:B	So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
RED:30:048:B	I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
RED:30:049:B	'Cause I remember it all, all, all
RED:30:050:V	They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
RED:30:051:V	Every time you double-cross my mind
RED:30:052:V	You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
RED:30:053:V	And that made me want to die
RED:30:054:V	The idea you had of me, who was she?
RED:30:055:V	A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
RED:30:056:V	Not weepin' in a party bathroom
RED:30:057:V	Some actress askin' me what happened, you
RED:30:058:V	That's what happened, you
RED:30:059:V	You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
RED:30:060:V	Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
RED:30:061:V	But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
RED:30:062:V	And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"
RED:30:063:V	Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
RED:30:064:V	I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
RED:30:065:V	After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
RED:30:066:V	Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
RED:30:067:V	But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
RED:30:068:V	'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
RED:30:069:V	You can't get rid of it
RED:30:070:V	'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
RED:30:071:C	'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
RED:30:072:C	Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
RED:30:073:C	It was rare, I was there
RED:30:074:C	I remember it all too well
RED:30:075:C	Wind in my hair, you were there
RED:30:076:C	You remember it all
RED:30:077:C	Down the stairs, you were there
RED:30:078:C	You remember it all
RED:30:079:C	It was rare, I was there
RED:30:080:C	I remember it all too well
RED:30:081:V	And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
RED:30:082:V	"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
RED:30:083:V	From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
RED:30:084:V	I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
RED:30:085:V	And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
RED:30:086:V	Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
RED:30:087:V	'Cause in this city's barren cold
RED:30:088:V	I still remember the first fall of snow
RED:30:089:V	And how it glistened as it fell
RED:30:090:V	I remember it all too well
RED:30:091:I	Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
RED:30:092:I	Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
RED:30:093:I	Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
RED:30:094:I	Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
RED:30:095:I	Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
RED:30:096:I	Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
RED:30:097:I	It was rare, you remember it all too well
RED:30:098:I	Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
RED:30:099:I	Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
RED:30:100:I	Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
RED:30:101:I	It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
RED:30:102:I	Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
RED:30:103:I	Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
RED:30:104:I	Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
RED:30:105:I	It was rare, you remember it
RED:30:106:I	Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
RED:30:107:I	Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
RED:30:108:I	Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
RED:30:109:I	It was rare, you remember it
NEN:01:001:V	Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
NEN:01:002:V	Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
NEN:01:003:V	Everybody here wanted somethin' more
NEN:01:004:V	Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
NEN:01:005:V	And it said
NEN:01:006:C	"Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you"
NEN:01:007:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:008:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:009:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:010:C	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
NEN:01:011:C	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
NEN:01:012:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:013:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:014:V	When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
NEN:01:015:V	Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
NEN:01:016:V	Everybody here was someone else before
NEN:01:017:V	And you can want who you want
NEN:01:018:V	Boys and boys and girls and girls
NEN:01:019:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:020:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:021:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:022:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:023:C	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
NEN:01:024:C	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
NEN:01:025:C	Welcome to New-York (New-York), it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:026:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:027:B	Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
NEN:01:028:B	Like any real love, it's ever-changing
NEN:01:029:B	Like any true love, it drives you crazy
NEN:01:030:B	But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
NEN:01:031:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:032:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:033:C	Welcome to New-York, it's been waitin' for you
NEN:01:034:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:035:C	It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
NEN:01:036:C	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
NEN:01:037:C	Welcome to New-York, new soundtrack
NEN:01:038:C	It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New-York
NEN:01:039:C	The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
NEN:01:040:C	Welcome to New-York, so bright, they never blind me
NEN:01:041:C	Welcome to New-York, welcome to New-York
NEN:02:001:V	Nice to meet you, where you been?
NEN:02:002:V	I could show you incredible things
NEN:02:003:V	Magic, madness, heaven, sin
NEN:02:004:V	Saw you there and I thought
NEN:02:005:V	"Oh, my god, look at that face
NEN:02:006:V	You look like my next mistake
NEN:02:007:V	Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
NEN:02:008:V	New money, suit and tie
NEN:02:009:V	I can read you like a magazine
NEN:02:010:V	Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
NEN:02:011:V	And I know you heard about me
NEN:02:012:V	So, hey, let's be friends
NEN:02:013:V	I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
NEN:02:014:V	Grab your passport and my hand
NEN:02:015:V	I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
NEN:02:016:C	So it's gonna be forever
NEN:02:017:C	Or it's gonna go down in flames?
NEN:02:018:C	You can tell me when it's over, mm
NEN:02:019:C	If the high was worth the pain
NEN:02:020:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers
NEN:02:021:C	They'll tell you I'm insane
NEN:02:022:C	'Cause you know I love the players
NEN:02:023:C	And you love the game
NEN:02:024:C	'Cause we're young and we're reckless
NEN:02:025:C	We'll take this way too far
NEN:02:026:C	It'll leave you breathless, mm
NEN:02:027:C	Or with a nasty scar
NEN:02:028:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers
NEN:02:029:C	They'll tell you I'm insane
NEN:02:030:C	But I've got a blank space, baby
NEN:02:031:C	And I'll write your name
NEN:02:032:V	Cherry lips, crystal skies
NEN:02:033:V	I could show you incredible things
NEN:02:034:V	Stolen kisses, pretty lies
NEN:02:035:V	You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
NEN:02:036:V	Find out what you want
NEN:02:037:V	Be that girl for a month
NEN:02:038:V	Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
NEN:02:039:V	Screaming, crying, perfect storms
NEN:02:040:V	I can make all the tables turn
NEN:02:041:V	Rose garden filled with thorns
NEN:02:042:V	Keep you second guessin', like
NEN:02:043:V	"Oh, my god, who is she?"
NEN:02:044:V	I get drunk on jealousy
NEN:02:045:V	But you'll come back each time you leave
NEN:02:046:V	'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
NEN:02:047:C	So it's gonna be forever
NEN:02:048:C	Or it's gonna go down in flames?
NEN:02:049:C	You can tell me when it's over, mm
NEN:02:050:C	If the high was worth the pain
NEN:02:051:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers

NEN:02:055:C	'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
NEN:02:056:C	We'll take this way too far
NEN:02:057:C	It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
NEN:02:058:C	Or with a nasty scar
NEN:02:059:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers
NEN:02:060:C	They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
NEN:02:061:C	But I've got a blank space, baby
NEN:02:062:C	And I'll write your name
NEN:02:063:B	Boys only want love if it's torture
NEN:02:064:B	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
NEN:02:065:B	Boys only want love if it's torture
NEN:02:066:B	Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
NEN:02:067:C	So it's gonna be forever
NEN:02:068:C	Or it's gonna go down in flames?
NEN:02:069:C	You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
NEN:02:070:C	If the high was worth the pain
NEN:02:071:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers
NEN:02:072:C	They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
NEN:02:073:C	'Cause you know I love the players
NEN:02:074:C	And you love the game (Love the game)
NEN:02:075:C	'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
NEN:02:076:C	We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
NEN:02:077:C	It'll leave you breathless, mm
NEN:02:078:C	Or with a nasty scar (Or leave a nasty scar)
NEN:02:079:C	Got a long list of ex-lovers
NEN:02:080:C	They'll tell you I'm insane
NEN:02:081:C	But I've got a blank space, baby
NEN:02:082:C	And I'll write your name
NEN:03:001:V	Midnight
NEN:03:002:V	You come and pick me up, no headlights
NEN:03:003:V	Long drive
NEN:03:004:V	Could end in burnin' flames or paradise
NEN:03:005:V	Fade into view, oh
NEN:03:006:V	It's been a while since I have even heard from you
NEN:03:007:V	(Heard from you)
NEN:03:008:C	I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
NEN:03:009:C	Know exactly where it leads, but I
NEN:03:010:C	Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
NEN:03:011:C	You got that James-Dean daydream look in your eye
NEN:03:012:C	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
NEN:03:013:C	And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
NEN:03:014:C	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
NEN:03:015:C	You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
NEN:03:016:C	And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
NEN:03:017:C	And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
NEN:03:018:C	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
NEN:03:019:V	So it goes
NEN:03:020:V	He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
NEN:03:021:V	Takes me home
NEN:03:022:V	Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, oh, yeah
NEN:03:023:V	I say, "I heard, oh
NEN:03:024:V	That you've been out and about with some other girl"
NEN:03:025:V	Some other girl
NEN:03:026:C	He says, "What you heard is true, but I
NEN:03:027:C	Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you," and I
NEN:03:028:C	I said, "I've been there too a few times"
NEN:03:029:C	'Cause you got that James-Dean daydream look in your eye
NEN:03:030:C	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
NEN:03:031:C	And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
NEN:03:032:C	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
NEN:03:033:C	You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
NEN:03:034:C	And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
NEN:03:035:C	And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
NEN:03:036:C	'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style
NEN:03:037:B	Take me home (Ah)
NEN:03:038:B	Just take me home (Ah)
NEN:03:039:B	Yeah, just take me home (Ah)
NEN:03:040:B	Woah, woah, oh (Out of style)
NEN:03:041:C	Oh, 'cause you got that James-Dean daydream look in your eye
NEN:03:042:C	And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
NEN:03:043:C	And when we go crashin' down (And when we go), we come back every time
NEN:03:044:C	'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
NEN:04:001:V	Looking at it now
NEN:04:002:V	It all seems so simple
NEN:04:003:V	We were lying on your couch
NEN:04:004:V	I remember
NEN:04:005:V	You took a Polaroid of us
NEN:04:006:V	Then discovered (Then discovered)
NEN:04:007:V	The rest of the world was black and white
NEN:04:008:V	But we were in screaming color
NEN:04:009:V	And I remember thinkin'
NEN:04:010:C	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
NEN:04:011:C	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
NEN:04:012:C	Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
NEN:04:013:C	Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
NEN:04:014:C	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
NEN:04:015:C	Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
NEN:04:016:C	Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
NEN:04:017:C	Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
NEN:04:018:C	(Are we out of the woods?)
NEN:04:019:V	Looking at it now

NEN:14:028:C	Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
NEN:14:029:C	Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire-Cat smile?

NEN:14:042:B	I reached for you, but you were gone
NEN:14:043:B	I knew I had to go back home
NEN:14:044:B	You searched the world for somethin' else
NEN:14:045:B	To make you feel like what we had
NEN:14:046:B	And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
NEN:14:047:B	Oh

NEN:15:012:C	You are in love, true love, you are in love
NEN:15:013:V	Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
NEN:15:014:V	You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
NEN:15:015:V	And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts
NEN:15:016:V	One step, not much, but it said enough
NEN:15:017:V	You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
NEN:15:018:V	One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
NEN:15:019:V	Pauses, then says, "You're my best friend"
NEN:15:020:V	And you knew what it was, he is in love
NEN:15:021:C	You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
NEN:15:022:C	You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you

NEN:15:024:C	You are in love, true love, you are in love
NEN:15:025:B	And so it goes
NEN:15:026:B	You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
NEN:15:027:B	And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
NEN:15:028:B	And you understand now
NEN:15:029:B	Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
NEN:15:030:B	And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
NEN:15:031:B	'Cause you can hear it in the silence
NEN:15:032:B	You can feel it on the way home
NEN:15:033:B	You can see it with the lights out

NEN:16:001:V	We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
NEN:16:002:V	We wait for trains that just aren't comin'
NEN:16:003:V	We show off our different scarlet letters
NEN:16:004:V	Trust me, mine is better
NEN:16:005:V	We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
NEN:16:006:V	We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
NEN:16:007:V	We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
NEN:16:008:V	Honey, life is just a classroom
NEN:16:009:V	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
NEN:16:010:C	'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
NEN:16:011:C	Out of all the bricks they threw at me
NEN:16:012:C	And every day is like a battle
NEN:16:013:C	But every night with us is like a dream

NEN:16:020:V	We hang back, it's all in the timing
NEN:16:021:V	It's poker, he can't see it in my face
NEN:16:022:V	But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
NEN:16:023:V	We need love, but all we want is danger
NEN:16:024:V	We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
NEN:16:025:V	The rumors are terrible and cruel
NEN:16:026:V	But, honey, most of them are true
NEN:16:027:V	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
NEN:16:028:C	'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
NEN:16:029:C	Out of all the bricks they threw at me

NEN:17:001:V	Flamingo pink, Sunrise-Boulevard
NEN:17:002:V	Clink, clink, being this young is art
NEN:17:003:V	Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
NEN:17:004:V	What if all I need is you?

NEN:17:020:V	The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
NEN:17:021:V	Everyone wants him, that was my crime
NEN:17:022:V	The wrong place at the right time
NEN:17:023:V	And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
NEN:17:024:V	In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
NEN:17:025:C	Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)

NEN:17:027:C	Love to think you'll never forget

NEN:17:035:B	Half asleep
NEN:17:036:B	Takin' your time in the tangerine
NEN:17:037:B	Neon light, this is luxury
NEN:17:038:B	You're not sayin' you're in love with me
NEN:17:039:B	But you're goin' to
NEN:17:040:B	Half awake
NEN:17:041:B	Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake
NEN:17:042:B	I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
NEN:17:043:B	I'm not sayin', "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
NEN:17:044:B	But you're going to

NEN:18:001:V	I've known it from the very start
NEN:18:002:V	We're a shot in the darkest dark
NEN:18:003:V	Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
NEN:18:004:V	The waiting is a sadness
NEN:18:005:V	Fading into madness
NEN:18:006:V	Oh no, oh no, it won't stop
NEN:18:007:R	I'm standin' on a tightrope alone
NEN:18:008:R	I hold my breath a little bit longer
NEN:18:009:R	Halfway out the door, but it won't close
NEN:18:010:R	I'm holdin' out hope for you to
NEN:18:011:C	Say, "Don't go"
NEN:18:012:C	I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
NEN:18:013:C	Why'd you have to lead me on?
NEN:18:014:C	Why'd you have to twist the knife?
NEN:18:015:C	Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?
NEN:18:016:C	Why'd you whisper in the dark
NEN:18:017:C	Just to leave me in the night?
NEN:18:018:C	Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'
NEN:18:019:C	(Say) Say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
NEN:18:020:C	I would stay forever if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
NEN:18:021:C	(Say, say, say, say)
NEN:18:022:V	Now I'm pacin' on shaky ground
NEN:18:023:V	Strike a match, then you blow it out
NEN:18:024:V	Oh no, oh no, it's not fair
NEN:18:025:V	'Cause you kiss me and it stops time
NEN:18:026:V	And I'm yours, but you're not mine
NEN:18:027:V	Oh no, oh no, you're not there
NEN:18:028:R	I'm standin' on the sidewalk alone
NEN:18:029:R	I wait for you to drive by
NEN:18:030:R	I'm tryna see the cards that you won't show
NEN:18:031:R	I'm about to fold unless you

NEN:18:044:B	Make me want you? (Make me want you)
NEN:18:045:B	Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)
NEN:18:046:B	Give me nothin' back?
NEN:18:047:B	Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)
NEN:18:048:B	Make me love you? (Make me love you)
NEN:18:049:B	I said, "I love you" (I said, "I love you")
NEN:18:050:B	You say nothin' back
NEN:18:051:C	Why'd you have to lead me on? (Oh)
NEN:18:052:C	Why'd you have to twist the knife?

NEN:18:060:I	But you won't, but you won't, but you won't
NEN:18:061:I	I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
NEN:18:062:I	But you won't, but you won't, but you won't
NEN:19:001:V	You went to a party
NEN:19:002:V	I heard from everybody
NEN:19:003:V	You part the crowd like the Red-Sea
NEN:19:004:V	Don't even get me started
NEN:19:005:V	Did you get anxious though
NEN:19:006:V	On the way home?
NEN:19:007:V	I guess I'll never, ever know
NEN:19:008:V	Now that we don't talk
NEN:19:009:V	You grew your hair long
NEN:19:010:V	You got new icons
NEN:19:011:V	And from the outside
NEN:19:012:V	It looks like you're tryin' lives on
NEN:19:013:V	I miss the old ways
NEN:19:014:V	You didn't have to change
NEN:19:015:V	But I guess I don't have a say
NEN:19:016:V	Now that we don't talk
NEN:19:017:C	I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
NEN:19:018:C	Remind myself, the more I gave, you'd want me less
NEN:19:019:C	I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
NEN:19:020:C	And what it cost, now that we don't talk
NEN:19:021:B	What do you tell your friends we
NEN:19:022:B	Shared dinners, long weekends with?
NEN:19:023:B	Truth is, I can't pretend it's
NEN:19:024:B	Platonic, it's just ended, so
NEN:19:025:C	I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
NEN:19:026:C	Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)
NEN:19:027:C	I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
NEN:19:028:C	And what it cost, now that we don't talk
NEN:19:029:I	I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
NEN:19:030:I	Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
NEN:19:031:I	With important men who think important thoughts
NEN:19:032:I	Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
NEN:19:033:I	And the only way back to my dignity
NEN:19:034:I	Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
NEN:19:035:I	Just like I had been when you were chasing me
NEN:19:036:I	Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk
NEN:20:001:V	You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
NEN:20:002:V	In my peripheral vision
NEN:20:003:V	I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
NEN:20:004:V	All was quickly forgiven
NEN:20:005:V	You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
NEN:20:006:V	Flush with the currency of cool
NEN:20:007:V	I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
NEN:20:008:V	And when it came to you
NEN:20:009:C	I didn't come here to make friends
NEN:20:010:C	We were born to be suburban legends
NEN:20:011:C	When you hold me, it holds me together
NEN:20:012:C	And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
NEN:20:013:V	I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
NEN:20:014:V	Would surprise the whole school
NEN:20:015:V	When I ended up back at our class reunion
NEN:20:016:V	Walkin' in with you
NEN:20:017:V	You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
NEN:20:018:V	With the pages ripped out
NEN:20:019:V	I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
NEN:20:020:V	And I can still see you now
NEN:20:021:C	I didn't come here to make friends
NEN:20:022:C	We were born to be suburban legends
NEN:20:023:C	When you hold me, it holds me together
NEN:20:024:C	And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
NEN:20:025:C	I know that you still remember
NEN:20:026:C	We were born to be national treasures
NEN:20:027:C	When you told me we'd get back together
NEN:20:028:C	And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
NEN:20:029:I	Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
NEN:20:030:I	I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
NEN:20:031:I	Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
NEN:20:032:I	You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined
NEN:20:033:I	Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
NEN:20:034:I	I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
NEN:20:035:I	Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
NEN:20:036:I	You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
NEN:20:037:I	That my life would be ruined
NEN:21:001:I	(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
NEN:21:002:V	Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:003:V	With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:004:V	I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:005:V	You still wouldn't go
NEN:21:006:C	Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
NEN:21:007:C	I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
NEN:21:008:C	You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
NEN:21:009:C	You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby
NEN:21:010:C	Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
NEN:21:011:C	Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
NEN:21:012:C	"Come here," I whispered in your ear
NEN:21:013:C	In your dream as you passed out, baby
NEN:21:014:C	Was it over then? And is it over now?
NEN:21:015:C	(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
NEN:21:016:V	When you lost control (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:017:V	Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:018:V	Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
NEN:21:019:V	Your new girl is my clone
NEN:21:020:B	And did you think I didn't see you?
NEN:21:021:B	There were flashin' lights
NEN:21:022:B	At least I had the decency
NEN:21:023:B	To keep my nights out of sight
NEN:21:024:B	Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
NEN:21:025:B	And my whispered sighs
NEN:21:026:B	Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
NEN:21:027:B	Off of very tall somethings
NEN:21:028:B	Just to see you come runnin'
NEN:21:029:B	And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no
NEN:21:030:C	Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
NEN:21:031:C	If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
NEN:21:032:C	You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
NEN:21:033:C	You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby
NEN:21:034:C	Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
NEN:21:035:C	Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
NEN:21:036:C	"Come here," I whispered in your ear
NEN:21:037:C	In your dream as you passed out, baby
NEN:21:038:C	Was it over then? And is it over now?
NEN:21:039:C	Uh-huh
NEN:21:040:C	(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
NEN:21:041:C	Uh-huh
NEN:21:042:C	(Is it? Is it?)
NEN:21:043:B	Think I didn't see you?
NEN:21:044:B	There were flashin' lights
NEN:21:045:B	At least I had the decency
NEN:21:046:B	To keep my nights out of sight

REP:13:007:C	So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
REP:13:008:C	I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
REP:13:009:C	This is why we can't have nice things, darlin'
REP:13:010:C	Because you break them, I had to take them away
REP:13:011:C	This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)

REP:13:017:V	And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
REP:13:018:V	Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
REP:13:019:V	And so I took an axe to a mended fence
REP:13:020:C	But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)

LVR:01:001:V	How many days did I spend thinking
LVR:01:002:V	'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
LVR:01:003:V	Lived in the shade you were throwing
LVR:01:004:V	'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
LVR:01:005:V	And I couldn't get away from ya
LVR:01:006:V	In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
LVR:01:007:V	Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
LVR:01:008:V	Free rent, living in my mind
LVR:01:009:C	But then something happened one magical night
LVR:01:010:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:011:C	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
LVR:01:012:C	And it was so nice
LVR:01:013:C	So peaceful and quiet
LVR:01:014:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:015:C	It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
LVR:01:016:C	I forgot that you
LVR:01:017:V	Got out some popcorn
LVR:01:018:V	As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
LVR:01:019:V	Laughed on the school yard
LVR:01:020:V	As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
LVR:01:021:V	And I would've stuck around for ya
LVR:01:022:V	Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
LVR:01:023:V	Would've been right there, front row
LVR:01:024:V	Even if nobody came to your show
LVR:01:025:C	But you showed who you are, then one magical night
LVR:01:026:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:027:C	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
LVR:01:028:C	And it was so nice
LVR:01:029:C	So peaceful and quiet
LVR:01:030:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:031:C	It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
LVR:01:032:C	I forgot that you
LVR:01:033:B	Sent me a clear message
LVR:01:034:B	Taught me some hard lessons
LVR:01:035:B	I just forget what they were
LVR:01:036:B	It's all just a blur
LVR:01:037:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:038:C	And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
LVR:01:039:C	And it was so nice
LVR:01:040:C	So peaceful and quiet
LVR:01:041:C	I forgot that you existed
LVR:01:042:C	I did, I did, I did
LVR:01:043:C	It isn't hate, it's just indifference
LVR:01:044:C	It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
LVR:01:045:C	So, yeah
LVR:02:001:I	(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
LVR:02:002:V	Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
LVR:02:003:V	You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
LVR:02:004:V	Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
LVR:02:005:V	You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
LVR:02:006:C	Killing me slow, out the window
LVR:02:007:C	I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
LVR:02:008:C	Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
LVR:02:009:C	What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
LVR:02:010:C	And it's new, the shape of your body
LVR:02:011:C	It's blue, the feeling I've got
LVR:02:012:C	And it's ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:013:C	It's a cruel summer
LVR:02:014:C	It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
LVR:02:015:C	No rules in breakable heaven
LVR:02:016:C	But ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:017:C	It's a cruel summer with you
LVR:02:018:V	Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
LVR:02:019:V	I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
LVR:02:020:V	We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
LVR:02:021:V	We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
LVR:02:022:C	So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
LVR:02:023:C	I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
LVR:02:024:C	Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
LVR:02:025:C	And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
LVR:02:026:C	It's new, the shape of your body
LVR:02:027:C	It's blue, the feeling I've got
LVR:02:028:C	And it's ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:029:C	It's a cruel summer
LVR:02:030:C	It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

LVR:02:032:C	But ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:033:C	It's a cruel summer with you
LVR:02:034:B	I'm drunk in the back of the car
LVR:02:035:B	And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
LVR:02:036:B	Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
LVR:02:037:B	I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
LVR:02:038:B	And I snuck in through the garden gate
LVR:02:039:B	Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
LVR:02:040:B	And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
LVR:02:041:B	I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
LVR:02:042:B	He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
LVR:02:043:C	It's new, the shape of your body
LVR:02:044:C	It's blue, the feeling I've got
LVR:02:045:C	And it's ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:046:C	It's a cruel summer
LVR:02:047:C	It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
LVR:02:048:C	No rules in breakable heaven
LVR:02:049:C	But ooh, woah-oh
LVR:02:050:C	It's a cruel summer with you
LVR:02:051:I	I'm drunk in the back of the car
LVR:02:052:I	And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
LVR:02:053:I	Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
LVR:02:054:I	I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
LVR:02:055:I	And I snuck in through the garden gate
LVR:02:056:I	Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
LVR:02:057:I	And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
LVR:02:058:I	I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
LVR:02:059:I	(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
LVR:03:001:V	We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
LVR:03:002:V	And this is our place, we make the rules
LVR:03:003:V	And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
LVR:03:004:V	Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
LVR:03:005:C	Can I go where you go?
LVR:03:006:C	Can we always be this close?
LVR:03:007:C	Forever and ever, ah
LVR:03:008:C	Take me out and take me home
LVR:03:009:C	You're my, my, my, my lover
LVR:03:010:V	We could let our friends crash in the living room
LVR:03:011:V	This is our place, we make the call
LVR:03:012:V	And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
LVR:03:013:V	I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
LVR:03:014:C	Can I go where you go?
LVR:03:015:C	Can we always be this close?
LVR:03:016:C	Forever and ever, ah
LVR:03:017:C	Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
LVR:03:018:C	You're my, my, my, my lover
LVR:03:019:B	Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
LVR:03:020:B	With every guitar string scar on my hand
LVR:03:021:B	I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
LVR:03:022:B	My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
LVR:03:023:B	All's well that ends well to end up with you
LVR:03:024:B	Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
LVR:03:025:B	And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
LVR:03:026:B	And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
LVR:03:027:C	Can I go where you go?
LVR:03:028:C	Can we always be this close?
LVR:03:029:C	Forever and ever, ah
LVR:03:030:C	Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
LVR:03:031:C	You're my, my, my, my
LVR:03:032:C	Oh, you're my, my, my, my
LVR:03:033:C	Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover
LVR:04:001:V	I would be complex, I would be cool
LVR:04:002:V	They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
LVR:04:003:V	And that would be okay for me to do
LVR:04:004:V	Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
LVR:04:005:C	I'd be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
LVR:04:006:C	When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
LVR:04:007:C	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
LVR:04:008:C	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
LVR:04:009:C	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
LVR:04:010:C	'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
LVR:04:011:C	I'd be the man (Man)
LVR:04:012:C	I'd be the man (Man)
LVR:04:013:V	They'd say I hustled, put in the work
LVR:04:014:V	They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
LVR:04:015:V	What I was wearing, if I was rude
LVR:04:016:V	Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
LVR:04:017:C	And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
LVR:04:018:C	I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
LVR:04:019:C	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
LVR:04:020:C	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
LVR:04:021:C	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
LVR:04:022:C	'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
LVR:04:023:C	I'd be the man (Man)
LVR:04:024:C	I'd be the man (Man)
LVR:04:025:B	What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
LVR:04:026:B	And getting bitches and models?
LVR:04:027:B	And it's all good if you're bad
LVR:04:028:B	And it's okay if you're mad
LVR:04:029:B	If I was out flashin' my dollars
LVR:04:030:B	I'd be a bitch, not a baller
LVR:04:031:B	They'd paint me out to be bad
LVR:04:032:B	So it's okay that I'm mad
LVR:04:033:C	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
LVR:04:034:C	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
LVR:04:035:C	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
LVR:04:036:C	'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
LVR:04:037:C	I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
LVR:04:038:C	Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
LVR:04:039:C	And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
LVR:04:040:C	'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
LVR:04:041:C	I'd be the man (Man)
LVR:04:042:C	I'd be the man (Man, oh)
LVR:04:043:C	I'd be the man (Man, yeah)
LVR:04:044:C	I'd be the man (Man, I'd be the man)
LVR:04:045:I	If I was a man
LVR:04:046:I	Then I'd be the man
LVR:05:001:V	Combat, I'm ready for combat
LVR:05:002:V	I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
LVR:05:003:V	'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
LVR:05:004:V	I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
LVR:05:005:C	Easy they come, easy they go
LVR:05:006:C	I jump from the train, I ride off alone
LVR:05:007:C	I never grew up, it's getting so old
LVR:05:008:C	Help me hold on to you
LVR:05:009:C	I've been the archer, I've been the prey
LVR:05:010:C	Who could ever leave me, darling
LVR:05:011:C	But who could stay?
LVR:05:012:V	Dark side, I search for your dark side
LVR:05:013:V	But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
LVR:05:014:V	And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
LVR:05:015:V	Then I hate my reflection for years and years
LVR:05:016:C	I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
LVR:05:017:C	The room is on fire, invisible smoke
LVR:05:018:C	And all of my heroes die all alone
LVR:05:019:C	Help me hold on to you
LVR:05:020:C	I've been the archer, I've been the prey
LVR:05:021:C	Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
LVR:05:022:C	But who could stay?
LVR:05:023:C	(I see right through me, I see right through me)
LVR:05:024:B	'Cause they see right through me
LVR:05:025:B	They see right through me
LVR:05:026:B	They see right through
LVR:05:027:B	Can you see right through me?
LVR:05:028:B	They see right through
LVR:05:029:B	They see right through me
LVR:05:030:B	I see right through me
LVR:05:031:B	I see right through me
LVR:05:032:C	All the king's horses, all the king's men
LVR:05:033:C	Couldn't put me together again
LVR:05:034:C	'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
LVR:05:035:C	Help me hold on to you
LVR:05:036:C	I've been the archer, I've been the prey
LVR:05:037:C	Who could ever leave me, darling
LVR:05:038:C	But who could stay?
LVR:05:039:C	(I see right through me, I see right through me)
LVR:05:040:C	Who could stay?
LVR:05:041:C	Who could stay?
LVR:05:042:C	Who could stay?
LVR:05:043:C	You could stay
LVR:05:044:C	You could stay
LVR:05:045:I	Combat, I'm ready for combat
LVR:06:001:V	I think he knows
LVR:06:002:V	His footprints on the sidewalk
LVR:06:003:V	Lead to where I can't stop
LVR:06:004:V	Go there every night
LVR:06:005:V	I think he knows
LVR:06:006:V	His hands around a cold glass
LVR:06:007:V	Make me wanna know that
LVR:06:008:V	Body like it's mine
LVR:06:009:C	He got that boyish look that I like in a man
LVR:06:010:C	I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
LVR:06:011:C	It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
LVR:06:012:C	No one understands
LVR:06:013:C	He got my heartbeat
LVR:06:014:C	Skipping down 16th-Avenue
LVR:06:015:C	Got that, ah, I mean
LVR:06:016:C	Wanna see what's under that attitude like
LVR:06:017:C	I want you, bless my soul
LVR:06:018:C	And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
LVR:06:019:C	I think he knows
LVR:06:020:V	I think he knows
LVR:06:021:V	When we get all alone
LVR:06:022:V	I'll make myself at home
LVR:06:023:V	And he'll want me to stay
LVR:06:024:V	I think he knows
LVR:06:025:V	He'd better lock it down
LVR:06:026:V	Or I won't stick around
LVR:06:027:V	'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
LVR:06:028:C	He got that boyish look that I like in a man
LVR:06:029:C	I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
LVR:06:030:C	He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
LVR:06:031:C	Boy, I understand
LVR:06:032:C	He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
LVR:06:033:C	Skipping down 16th-Avenue

LVR:06:042:C	I want you, bless my soul
LVR:06:043:B	Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
LVR:06:044:B	We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
LVR:06:045:B	Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
LVR:06:046:B	We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
LVR:06:047:B	"So where we gonna go?"
LVR:06:048:B	I whisper in the dark
LVR:06:049:B	"Where we gonna go?"
LVR:06:050:B	I think he knows
LVR:06:051:C	He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
LVR:06:052:C	Skipping down 16th-Avenue (Baby)

LVR:06:065:C	And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
LVR:07:001:V	You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
LVR:07:002:V	Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
LVR:07:003:V	Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
LVR:07:004:V	I'm lost in the lights
LVR:07:005:V	American glory faded before me
LVR:07:006:V	Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
LVR:07:007:V	Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
LVR:07:008:V	And ran for my life (Ah)
LVR:07:009:C	No cameras catch my pageant smile
LVR:07:010:C	I counted days, I counted miles
LVR:07:011:C	To see you there, to see you there
LVR:07:012:C	It's been a long time coming, but
LVR:07:013:C	It's you and me, that's my whole world
LVR:07:014:C	They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
LVR:07:015:C	The whole school is rolling fake dice
LVR:07:016:C	You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
LVR:07:017:C	It's you and me, there's nothing like this
LVR:07:018:C	Miss-Americana and The-Heartbreak-Prince (Okay)
LVR:07:019:C	We're so sad, we paint the town blue
LVR:07:020:C	Voted most likely to run away with you
LVR:07:021:V	My team is losing, battered and bruising
LVR:07:022:V	I see the high fives between the bad guys
LVR:07:023:V	Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
LVR:07:024:V	Who seems to care
LVR:07:025:V	American stories burning before me
LVR:07:026:V	I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
LVR:07:027:V	Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
LVR:07:028:V	Darling, I'm scared (Ah)
LVR:07:029:C	No cameras catch my muffled cries
LVR:07:030:C	I counted days, I counted miles
LVR:07:031:C	To see you there, to see you there
LVR:07:032:C	And now the storm is coming, but
LVR:07:033:C	It's you and me, that's my whole world
LVR:07:034:C	They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
LVR:07:035:C	The whole school is rolling fake dice
LVR:07:036:C	You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
LVR:07:037:C	It's you and me, there's nothing like this
LVR:07:038:C	Miss-Americana and The-Heartbreak-Prince (Okay)
LVR:07:039:C	We're so sad, we paint the town blue
LVR:07:040:C	Voted most likely to run away with you

LVR:07:048:B	That someday we're gonna (Win)
LVR:07:049:C	It's you and me, that's my whole world

LVR:07:061:I	They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
LVR:07:062:I	"She's a bad, bad girl"
LVR:08:001:V	The moon is high
LVR:08:002:V	Like your friends were the night that we first met
LVR:08:003:V	Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
LVR:08:004:V	Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
LVR:08:005:V	The wine is cold
LVR:08:006:V	Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
LVR:08:007:V	Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
LVR:08:008:V	Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
LVR:08:009:C	(Ayy)
LVR:08:010:C	Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
LVR:08:011:C	Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
LVR:08:012:C	Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
LVR:08:013:C	I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
LVR:08:014:C	Uh-huh, that's right
LVR:08:015:C	Darling, you're the one I want, and
LVR:08:016:C	I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
LVR:08:017:C	Uh-huh, that's right
LVR:08:018:C	Darling, you're the one I want
LVR:08:019:C	In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
LVR:08:020:C	Oh, you're the one I want
LVR:08:021:V	In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
LVR:08:022:V	When you jumped in first, I went in too
LVR:08:023:V	I'm with you even if it makes me blue
LVR:08:024:V	Which takes me back
LVR:08:025:V	To the color that we painted your brother's wall
LVR:08:026:V	Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
LVR:08:027:V	We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
LVR:08:028:C	(Ayy)
LVR:08:029:C	Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
LVR:08:030:C	Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
LVR:08:031:C	Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
LVR:08:032:C	Ah
LVR:08:033:C	I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
LVR:08:034:C	Uh-huh, that's right
LVR:08:035:C	Darling, you're the one I want, and
LVR:08:036:C	I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
LVR:08:037:C	Uh-huh, that's right
LVR:08:038:C	Darling, you're the one I want
LVR:08:039:C	In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
LVR:08:040:C	Oh, you're the one I want
LVR:08:041:B	I want to drive away with you
LVR:08:042:B	I want your complications too
LVR:08:043:B	I want your dreary Mondays
LVR:08:044:B	Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
LVR:08:045:B	I want to drive away with you
LVR:08:046:B	I want your complications too
LVR:08:047:B	I want your dreary Mondays
LVR:08:048:B	Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
LVR:08:049:B	Uh-huh
LVR:08:050:C	I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
LVR:08:051:C	Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want

LVR:08:059:C	Darling, you're the one I want
LVR:08:060:C	In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams

LVR:08:062:C	In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
LVR:08:063:C	Oh, you're the one I want
LVR:08:064:I	You're the one I want, one I want
LVR:08:065:I	You're the one I want, one I want
LVR:09:001:V	We were in the backseat
LVR:09:002:V	Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
LVR:09:003:V	"I rent a place on Cornelia-Street"
LVR:09:004:V	I say casually in the car
LVR:09:005:V	We were a fresh page on the desk
LVR:09:006:V	Filling in the blanks as we go
LVR:09:007:V	As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
LVR:09:008:V	Leading us home
LVR:09:009:C	And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
LVR:09:010:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:011:C	That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
LVR:09:012:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:013:C	And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
LVR:09:014:C	And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
LVR:09:015:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:016:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:017:V	Windows flung right open, autumn air
LVR:09:018:V	Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
LVR:09:019:V	We bless the rains on Cornelia-Street
LVR:09:020:V	Memorize the creaks in the floor
LVR:09:021:V	Back when we were card sharks, playing games
LVR:09:022:V	I thought you were leading me on
LVR:09:023:V	I packed my bags, left Cornelia-Street
LVR:09:024:V	Before you even knew I was gone
LVR:09:025:C	But then you called, showed your hand
LVR:09:026:C	I turned around before I hit the tunnel
LVR:09:027:C	Sat on the roof, you and I
LVR:09:028:C	I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
LVR:09:029:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:030:C	That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
LVR:09:031:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:032:C	And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
LVR:09:033:C	And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
LVR:09:034:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:035:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:036:B	You hold my hand on the street
LVR:09:037:B	Walk me back to that apartment
LVR:09:038:B	Years ago, we were just inside
LVR:09:039:B	Barefoot in the kitchen
LVR:09:040:B	Sacred new beginnings
LVR:09:041:B	That became my religion, listen
LVR:09:042:C	I hope I never lose you
LVR:09:043:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:044:C	Oh, never again
LVR:09:045:C	And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
LVR:09:046:C	And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
LVR:09:047:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:048:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:049:C	I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
LVR:09:050:C	I'd never walk Cornelia-Street again
LVR:09:051:C	I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)
LVR:09:052:I	"I rent a place on Cornelia-Street"
LVR:09:053:I	I say casually in the car
LVR:10:001:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:002:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:003:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:004:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:005:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:006:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:007:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:008:I	My, my, my, my
LVR:10:009:C	Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
LVR:10:010:C	Flashbacks waking me up
LVR:10:011:C	I get drunk, but it's not enough
LVR:10:012:C	'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
LVR:10:013:C	I look through the windows of this love
LVR:10:014:C	Even though we boarded them up
LVR:10:015:C	Chandelier's still flickering here
LVR:10:016:C	'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
LVR:10:017:C	It's death by a thousand cuts
LVR:10:018:V	I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
LVR:10:019:V	I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
LVR:10:020:V	They say, "I don't know"
LVR:10:021:V	And what once was ours is no one's now
LVR:10:022:V	I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
LVR:10:023:V	Is this small town
LVR:10:024:V	You said it was a great love, one for the ages
LVR:10:025:V	But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?
LVR:10:026:C	'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
LVR:10:027:C	Flashbacks waking me up
LVR:10:028:C	I get drunk, but it's not enough
LVR:10:029:C	'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
LVR:10:030:C	I look through the windows of this love
LVR:10:031:C	Even though we boarded them up
LVR:10:032:C	Chandelier's still flickering here
LVR:10:033:C	'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
LVR:10:034:C	It's death by a thousand cuts
LVR:10:035:B	My heart, my hips, my body, my love
LVR:10:036:B	Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
LVR:10:037:B	Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
LVR:10:038:B	Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
LVR:10:039:B	Our songs, our films, united we stand
LVR:10:040:B	Our country, guess it was a lawless land
LVR:10:041:B	Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
LVR:10:042:B	Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
LVR:10:043:B	My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
LVR:10:044:B	Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
LVR:10:045:B	Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
LVR:10:046:B	But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
LVR:10:047:C	I get drunk, but it's not enough
LVR:10:048:C	'Cause you're not my baby
LVR:10:049:C	I look through the windows of this love
LVR:10:050:C	Even though we boarded them up
LVR:10:051:C	Chandelier's still flickering here
LVR:10:052:C	'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
LVR:10:053:C	No, it's not
LVR:10:054:C	It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
LVR:10:055:C	Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
LVR:10:056:C	My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
LVR:10:057:C	But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
LVR:10:058:I	I take the long way home
LVR:10:059:I	I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
LVR:10:060:I	They say, "I don't know"
LVR:11:001:I	We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
LVR:11:002:I	Uh, you know, just 'round London (Oh, I'd—)
LVR:11:003:V	I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
LVR:11:004:V	And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
LVR:11:005:V	But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
LVR:11:006:V	I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
LVR:11:007:C	They say, "Home is where the heart is"
LVR:11:008:C	But that's not where mine lives
LVR:11:009:C	You know I love a London boy
LVR:11:010:C	I enjoy walkin' Camden-Market in the afternoon
LVR:11:011:C	He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
LVR:11:012:C	Darling, I fancy you
LVR:11:013:C	Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
LVR:11:014:C	So I guess all the rumors are true
LVR:11:015:C	You know I love a London boy
LVR:11:016:C	Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)
LVR:11:017:V	And now I love high tea, stories from Uni and the West-End
LVR:11:018:V	You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
LVR:11:019:V	Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
LVR:11:020:V	Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
LVR:11:021:C	They say, "Home is where the heart is"
LVR:11:022:C	But, god, I love the English
LVR:11:023:C	You know I love a London boy
LVR:11:024:C	I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
LVR:11:025:C	He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
LVR:11:026:C	Darling, I fancy you
LVR:11:027:C	Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
LVR:11:028:C	So I guess all the rumors are true

LVR:11:035:B	Stick with me, I'm your queen
LVR:11:036:B	Like a Tennessee Stella-McCartney on the Heath
LVR:11:037:B	Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
LVR:11:038:B	Wanna be with you, oh, woah
LVR:11:039:C	You know I love a London boy

LVR:11:054:I	I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you, ah-ah (Ooh)
LVR:12:001:V	The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
LVR:12:002:V	In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
LVR:12:003:V	That was the first time we were there
LVR:12:004:V	Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
LVR:12:005:V	Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
LVR:12:006:V	And I say to you
LVR:12:007:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:008:C	Soon, you'll get better
LVR:12:009:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:010:C	Soon, you'll get better
LVR:12:011:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:012:C	You'll get better soon
LVR:12:013:C	'Cause you have to
LVR:12:014:V	I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
LVR:12:015:V	You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
LVR:12:016:V	I just pretend it isn't real
LVR:12:017:V	I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
LVR:12:018:V	I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
LVR:12:019:V	And I say to you
LVR:12:020:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:021:C	Soon, you'll get better
LVR:12:022:C	Ooh-ah

LVR:12:024:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:025:C	You'll get better soon
LVR:12:026:C	'Cause you have to
LVR:12:027:B	And I hate to make this all about me
LVR:12:028:B	But who am I supposed to talk to?
LVR:12:029:B	What am I supposed to do
LVR:12:030:B	If there's no you?
LVR:12:031:C	This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
LVR:12:032:C	It's been years of hoping and I keep saying it because
LVR:12:033:C	'Cause I have to
LVR:12:034:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:035:C	You'll get better
LVR:12:036:C	Ooh-ah

LVR:12:044:C	Ooh-ah
LVR:12:045:C	You'll get better soon
LVR:12:046:C	'Cause you have to
LVR:13:001:V	We were crazy to think
LVR:13:002:V	Crazy to think that this could work
LVR:13:003:V	Remember how I said I'd die for you?
LVR:13:004:V	We were stupid to jump
LVR:13:005:V	In the ocean separating us
LVR:13:006:V	Remember how I'd fly to you?
LVR:13:007:C	And I can't talk to you when you're like this
LVR:13:008:C	Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
LVR:13:009:C	I'm New-York City
LVR:13:010:C	I still do it for you, babe
LVR:13:011:C	They all warned us about times like this
LVR:13:012:C	They say the road gets hard and you get lost
LVR:13:013:C	When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
LVR:13:014:C	But we might just get away with it
LVR:13:015:C	Religion's in your lips
LVR:13:016:C	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:017:C	We'd still worship
LVR:13:018:C	We might just get away with it
LVR:13:019:C	The altar is my hips
LVR:13:020:C	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:021:C	We'd still worship this love
LVR:13:022:C	We'd still worship this love
LVR:13:023:C	We'd still worship this love
LVR:13:024:V	I know heaven's a thing
LVR:13:025:V	I go there when you touch me, honey
LVR:13:026:V	Hell is when I fight with you
LVR:13:027:V	But we can patch it up good
LVR:13:028:V	Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
LVR:13:029:V	Got the wine for you
LVR:13:030:C	And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
LVR:13:031:C	Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
LVR:13:032:C	You're the West-Village
LVR:13:033:C	You still do it for me, babe
LVR:13:034:C	They all warned us about times like this
LVR:13:035:C	They say the road gets hard and you get lost
LVR:13:036:C	When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
LVR:13:037:C	But we might just get away with it
LVR:13:038:C	Religion's in your lips
LVR:13:039:C	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:040:C	We'd still worship
LVR:13:041:C	We might just get away with it
LVR:13:042:C	The altar is my hips
LVR:13:043:C	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:044:C	We'd still worship this love
LVR:13:045:C	We'd still worship this love
LVR:13:046:C	We'd still worship this love, ah
LVR:13:047:I	Still worship this love
LVR:13:048:I	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:049:I	Even if it's a false god
LVR:13:050:I	Still worship this love
LVR:14:001:V	You are somebody that I don't know
LVR:14:002:V	But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
LVR:14:003:V	And I'm just like, damn, it's 7AM
LVR:14:004:V	Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
LVR:14:005:V	But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
LVR:14:006:V	And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
LVR:14:007:C	And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
LVR:14:008:C	But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
LVR:14:009:C	And snakes and stones never broke my bones
LVR:14:010:C	So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
LVR:14:011:C	You need to calm down, you're being too loud
LVR:14:012:C	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
LVR:14:013:C	You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
LVR:14:014:C	You need to calm down
LVR:14:015:V	You are somebody that we don't know
LVR:14:016:V	But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
LVR:14:017:V	Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
LVR:14:018:V	Sunshine on the street at the parade
LVR:14:019:V	But you would rather be in the dark ages
LVR:14:020:V	Makin' that sign must've taken all night
LVR:14:021:C	You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
LVR:14:022:C	And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
LVR:14:023:C	'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
LVR:14:024:C	So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
LVR:14:025:C	You need to calm down, you're being too loud
LVR:14:026:C	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
LVR:14:027:C	You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
LVR:14:028:C	You need to calm down
LVR:14:029:B	And we see you over there on the internet
LVR:14:030:B	Comparing all the girls who are killing it
LVR:14:031:B	But we figured you out
LVR:14:032:B	We all know now we all got crowns
LVR:14:033:B	You need to calm down
LVR:14:034:C	Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

LVR:14:037:C	And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
LVR:14:038:C	You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
LVR:14:039:C	Like can you just not step on our gowns?
LVR:14:040:C	You need to calm down
LVR:15:001:V	I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
LVR:15:002:V	Put you in jail for something you didn't do
LVR:15:003:V	I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
LVR:15:004:V	Thought I had reason to attack, but no
LVR:15:005:C	Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
LVR:15:006:C	Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
LVR:15:007:C	Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
LVR:15:008:C	It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

LVR:15:014:C	I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
LVR:15:015:C	I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
LVR:15:016:C	Meet me in the afterglow
LVR:15:017:V	It's so excruciating to see you low
LVR:15:018:V	Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
LVR:15:019:V	This ultraviolet morning light below
LVR:15:020:V	Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
LVR:15:021:C	I lived like an island, punished you with silence
LVR:15:022:C	Went off like sirens, just crying
LVR:15:023:C	Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
LVR:15:024:C	It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
LVR:15:025:C	Hey, it's all me, in my head
LVR:15:026:C	I'm the one who burned us down
LVR:15:027:C	But it's not what I meant

LVR:15:034:B	Tell me that we'll be just fine
LVR:15:035:B	Even when I lose my mind
LVR:15:036:B	I need to say
LVR:15:037:B	Tell me that it's not my fault
LVR:15:038:B	Tell me that I'm all you want
LVR:15:039:B	Even when I break your heart
LVR:15:040:B	I need to say
LVR:15:041:C	Hey, it's all me, in my head
LVR:15:042:C	I'm the one who burned us down
LVR:15:043:C	But it's not what I meant
LVR:15:044:C	Sorry that I hurt you
LVR:15:045:C	I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
LVR:15:046:C	I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
LVR:15:047:C	I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
LVR:15:048:C	Meet me in the afterglow
LVR:16:001:I	I promise that you'll never find another like me
LVR:16:002:V	I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
LVR:16:003:V	I know I never think before I jump

LVR:16:008:V	And trouble's gonna follow where I go
LVR:16:009:V	(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)
LVR:16:010:C	But one of these things is not like the others
LVR:16:011:C	Like a rainbow with all of the colors
LVR:16:012:C	Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
LVR:16:013:C	I promise that you'll never find another like
LVR:16:014:C	Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

LVR:16:028:V	(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)
LVR:16:029:C	'Cause one of these things is not like the others
LVR:16:030:C	Livin' in winter, I am your summer
LVR:16:031:C	Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
LVR:16:032:C	I promise that you'll never find another like
LVR:16:033:C	Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

LVR:17:003:V	School bell rings, walk me home
LVR:17:004:V	Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
LVR:17:005:V	Lost my gloves, you give me one
LVR:17:006:V	"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
LVR:17:007:V	Video games, you pass me a note

LVR:17:009:C	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
LVR:17:010:C	It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
LVR:17:011:V	Light pink sky, up on the roof
LVR:17:012:V	Sun sinks down, no curfew
LVR:17:013:V	Twenty questions, we tell the truth
LVR:17:014:V	You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too

LVR:18:001:V	My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
LVR:18:002:V	Everyone looked worse in the light
LVR:18:003:V	There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
LVR:18:004:V	I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye
LVR:18:005:C	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
LVR:18:006:C	I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
LVR:18:007:C	I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
LVR:18:008:C	And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
LVR:18:009:V	Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
LVR:18:010:V	And so I became the butt of the joke
LVR:18:011:V	I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
LVR:18:012:V	Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
LVR:18:013:C	Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
LVR:18:014:C	Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
LVR:18:015:C	Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
LVR:18:016:C	It's brighter now, now
LVR:18:017:C	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

LVR:18:024:C	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
LVR:18:025:C	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
LVR:18:026:B	And I can still see it all (In my mind)
LVR:18:027:B	All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
LVR:18:028:B	I once believed love would be (Black and white)
LVR:18:029:B	But it's golden (Golden)
LVR:18:030:B	And I can still see it all (In my head)
LVR:18:031:B	Back and forth from New-York (Sneakin' in your bed)
LVR:18:032:B	I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)
LVR:18:033:B	But it's golden
LVR:18:034:B	Like daylight, like daylight
LVR:18:035:B	Like daylight, daylight
LVR:18:036:C	I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

LVR:18:045:C	(And I can still see it all)
LVR:18:046:C	I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

LVR:18:052:I	You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
LVR:18:053:I	Just let it go, let it go
LVR:18:054:I	I wanna be defined by the things that I love
LVR:18:055:I	Not the things I hate
LVR:18:056:I	Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
LVR:18:057:I	Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
LVR:18:058:I	I, I just think that
LVR:18:059:I	You are what you love
FOL:01:001:V	I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit

FOL:11:007:C	Time, curious time
FOL:11:008:C	Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
FOL:11:009:C	Were there clues I didn't see?
FOL:11:010:C	And isn't it just so pretty to think
FOL:11:011:C	All along there was some
FOL:11:012:C	Invisible string
FOL:11:013:C	Tying you to me?

FOL:14:001:V	Betty, I won't make assumptions
FOL:14:002:V	About why you switched your homeroom, but
FOL:14:003:V	I think it's 'cause of me
FOL:14:004:V	Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
FOL:14:005:V	When I passed your house

FOL:14:010:C	The worst thing that I ever did
FOL:14:011:C	Was what I did to you

FOL:14:013:C	Would you have me? Would you want me?
FOL:14:014:C	Would you tell me to go fuck myself
FOL:14:015:C	Or lead me to the garden?
FOL:14:016:C	In the garden, would you trust me
FOL:14:017:C	If I told you it was just a summer thing?
FOL:14:018:C	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
FOL:14:019:C	But I know I miss you
FOL:14:020:V	Betty, I know where it all went wrong
FOL:14:021:V	Your favorite song was playing
FOL:14:022:V	From the far side of the gym
FOL:14:023:V	I was nowhere to be found
FOL:14:024:V	I hate the crowds, you know that

FOL:14:037:C	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
FOL:14:038:C	But I know I miss you
FOL:14:039:B	I was walking home on broken cobblestones
FOL:14:040:B	Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
FOL:14:041:B	A figment of my worst intentions
FOL:14:042:B	She said, "James, get in, let's drive"
FOL:14:043:B	Those days turned into nights
FOL:14:044:B	Slept next to her, but
FOL:14:045:B	I dreamt of you all summer long
FOL:14:046:V	Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
FOL:14:047:V	And I planned it out for weeks now
FOL:14:048:V	But it's finally sinkin' in
FOL:14:049:V	Betty, right now is the last time
FOL:14:050:V	I can dream about what happens when
FOL:14:051:V	You see my face again
FOL:14:052:C	The only thing I wanna do
FOL:14:053:C	Is make it up to you
FOL:14:054:C	So I showed up at your party
FOL:14:055:C	Yeah, I showed up at your party
FOL:14:056:C	Yeah, I showed up at your party
FOL:14:057:C	Will you have me? Will you love me?
FOL:14:058:C	Will you kiss me on the porch
FOL:14:059:C	In front of all your stupid friends?
FOL:14:060:C	If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
FOL:14:061:C	Will it patch your broken wings?
FOL:14:062:C	I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
FOL:14:063:C	But I know I miss you
FOL:14:064:I	Standing in your cardigan
FOL:14:065:I	Kissin' in my car again
FOL:14:066:I	Stopped at a streetlight
FOL:14:067:I	You know I miss you
FOL:15:001:V	Our coming-of-age has come and gone
FOL:15:002:V	Suddenly, this summer, it's clear
FOL:15:003:V	I never had the courage of my convictions
FOL:15:004:V	As long as danger is near
FOL:15:005:V	And it's just around the corner, darlin'
FOL:15:006:V	'Cause it lives in me
FOL:15:007:V	No, I could never give you peace
FOL:15:008:C	But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
FOL:15:009:C	If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
FOL:15:010:C	All these people think love's for show
FOL:15:011:C	But I would die for you in secret
FOL:15:012:C	The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
FOL:15:013:C	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
FOL:15:014:V	Your integrity makes me seem small
FOL:15:015:V	You paint dreamscapes on the wall
FOL:15:016:V	I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
FOL:15:017:V	And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
FOL:15:018:V	Sit with you in the trenches
FOL:15:019:V	Give you my wild, give you a child
FOL:15:020:V	Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
FOL:15:021:V	Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
FOL:15:022:V	Is it enough?
FOL:15:023:V	But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
FOL:15:024:V	I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
FOL:15:025:V	But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
FOL:15:026:C	But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
FOL:15:027:C	If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
FOL:15:028:C	All these people think love's for show
FOL:15:029:C	But I would die for you in secret
FOL:15:030:C	The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
FOL:15:031:C	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
FOL:15:032:C	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
FOL:15:033:C	Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
FOL:16:001:V	My only one
FOL:16:002:V	My smoking gun
FOL:16:003:V	My eclipsed sun
FOL:16:004:V	This has broken me down
FOL:16:005:V	My twisted knife
FOL:16:006:V	My sleepless night
FOL:16:007:V	My winless fight
FOL:16:008:V	This has frozen my ground
FOL:16:009:C	Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
FOL:16:010:C	Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
FOL:16:011:C	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
FOL:16:012:C	No other sadness in the world would do
FOL:16:013:V	My best laid plan
FOL:16:014:V	Your sleight of hand
FOL:16:015:V	My barren land
FOL:16:016:V	I am ash from your fire
FOL:16:017:C	Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
FOL:16:018:C	Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
FOL:16:019:C	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
FOL:16:020:C	No other sadness in the world would do
FOL:16:021:B	You know I left a part of me back in New-York
FOL:16:022:B	You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
FOL:16:023:B	You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
FOL:16:024:B	From when they pulled me apart
FOL:16:025:B	You knew the password so I let you in the door
FOL:16:026:B	You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
FOL:16:027:B	You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
FOL:16:028:B	From when they pulled me apart
FOL:16:029:B	But what you did was just as dark
FOL:16:030:B	(Ah, ah, ah)
FOL:16:031:B	Darling, this was just as hard
FOL:16:032:B	As when they pulled me apart
FOL:16:033:I	My only one
FOL:16:034:I	My kingdom come undone
FOL:16:035:I	My broken drum
FOL:16:036:I	You have beaten my heart
FOL:16:037:I	Don't want no other shade of blue but you
FOL:16:038:I	No other sadness in the world would do
FOL:17:001:V	Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
FOL:17:002:V	I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
FOL:17:003:V	These hunters with cell phones
FOL:17:004:C	Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
FOL:17:005:C	I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
FOL:17:006:C	Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
FOL:17:007:C	I'm setting off, but not without my muse
FOL:17:008:V	What should be over, burrowed under my skin
FOL:17:009:V	In heart-stopping waves of hurt
FOL:17:010:V	I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
FOL:17:011:V	Tell me what are my words worth
FOL:17:012:C	Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
FOL:17:013:C	I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
FOL:17:014:C	Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
FOL:17:015:C	I'm setting off, but not without my muse
FOL:17:016:B	I want auroras and sad prose
FOL:17:017:B	I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
FOL:17:018:B	'Cause I haven't moved in years
FOL:17:019:B	And I want you right here
FOL:17:020:B	A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
FOL:17:021:B	With no one around to tweet it
FOL:17:022:B	While I bathe in cliffside pools
FOL:17:023:B	With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
FOL:17:024:C	Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
FOL:17:025:C	I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
FOL:17:026:C	Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
FOL:17:027:C	I'm setting off, but not without my muse
FOL:17:028:C	No, not without you
EVE:01:001:V	I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
EVE:01:002:V	Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
EVE:01:003:V	And if it was an open-shut case
EVE:01:004:V	I never would've known from that look on your face
EVE:01:005:V	Lost in your current like a priceless wine
EVE:01:006:C	The more that you say, the less I know
EVE:01:007:C	Wherever you stray, I follow
EVE:01:008:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:009:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:010:V	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
EVE:01:011:V	Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
EVE:01:012:V	As if you were a mythical thing
EVE:01:013:V	Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
EVE:01:014:V	And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
EVE:01:015:C	The more that you say, the less I know
EVE:01:016:C	Wherever you stray, I follow
EVE:01:017:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:018:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:019:C	You know that my train could take you home
EVE:01:020:C	Anywhere else is hollow
EVE:01:021:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:022:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:023:B	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
EVE:01:024:B	They count me out time and time again
EVE:01:025:B	Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
EVE:01:026:B	But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
EVE:01:027:V	Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
EVE:01:028:V	Show me the places where the others gave you scars
EVE:01:029:V	Now this is an open-shut case
EVE:01:030:V	I guess I should've known from the look on your face
EVE:01:031:V	Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
EVE:01:032:C	The more that you say, the less I know
EVE:01:033:C	Wherever you stray, I follow
EVE:01:034:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:035:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:036:C	You know that my train could take you home
EVE:01:037:C	Anywhere else is hollow
EVE:01:038:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:039:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:040:C	The more that you say, the less I know
EVE:01:041:C	Wherever you stray, I follow
EVE:01:042:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:043:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:044:C	You know that my train could take you home
EVE:01:045:C	Anywhere else is hollow
EVE:01:046:C	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:047:C	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:01:048:I	Hey, that's my man
EVE:01:049:I	That's my man
EVE:01:050:I	Yeah, that's my man
EVE:01:051:I	Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
EVE:01:052:I	That's my man
EVE:01:053:I	Hey, that's my man
EVE:01:054:I	I'm begging for you to take my hand
EVE:01:055:I	Wreck my plans, that's my man
EVE:02:001:V	You booked the night train for a reason
EVE:02:002:V	So you could sit there in this hurt
EVE:02:003:V	Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
EVE:02:004:V	You're not sure which is worse
EVE:02:005:C	Because I dropped your hand while dancing
EVE:02:006:C	Left you out there standing
EVE:02:007:C	Crestfallen on the landing
EVE:02:008:C	Champagne problems
EVE:02:009:C	Your mom's ring in your pocket
EVE:02:010:C	My picture in your wallet
EVE:02:011:C	Your heart was glass, I dropped it
EVE:02:012:C	Champagne problems
EVE:02:013:V	You told your family for a reason
EVE:02:014:V	You couldn't keep it in
EVE:02:015:V	Your sister splashed out on the bottle
EVE:02:016:V	Now no one's celebrating
EVE:02:017:C	Dom-Pérignon, you brought it
EVE:02:018:C	No crowd of friends applauded
EVE:02:019:C	Your hometown skeptics called it
EVE:02:020:C	Champagne problems
EVE:02:021:C	You had a speech, you're speechless
EVE:02:022:C	Love slipped beyond your reaches
EVE:02:023:C	And I couldn't give a reason
EVE:02:024:C	Champagne problems
EVE:02:025:B	Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
EVE:02:026:B	November flush and your flannel cure
EVE:02:027:B	"This dorm was once a madhouse"
EVE:02:028:B	I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
EVE:02:029:B	How evergreen, our group of friends
EVE:02:030:B	Don't think we'll say that word again
EVE:02:031:B	And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
EVE:02:032:B	That we once walked through
EVE:02:033:B	One for the money, two for the show
EVE:02:034:B	I never was ready so I watch you go
EVE:02:035:B	Sometimes you just don't know the answer
EVE:02:036:B	'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
EVE:02:037:B	"She would've made such a lovely bride
EVE:02:038:B	What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
EVE:02:039:B	But you'll find the real thing instead
EVE:02:040:B	She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
EVE:02:041:C	And hold your hand while dancing
EVE:02:042:C	Never leave you standing
EVE:02:043:C	Crestfallen on the landing
EVE:02:044:C	With champagne problems
EVE:02:045:C	Your mom's ring in your pocket
EVE:02:046:C	Her picture in your wallet
EVE:02:047:C	You won't remember all my
EVE:02:048:C	Champagne problems
EVE:02:049:I	You won't remember all my
EVE:02:050:I	Champagne problems
EVE:03:001:I	Gleaming, twinkling
EVE:03:002:I	Eyes like sinking
EVE:03:003:I	Ships on waters
EVE:03:004:I	So inviting, I almost jump in
EVE:03:005:C	But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
EVE:03:006:C	I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
EVE:03:007:C	I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
EVE:03:008:C	Everybody wants you
EVE:03:009:C	Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
EVE:03:010:C	Walk past, quick brush
EVE:03:011:C	I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
EVE:03:012:C	I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
EVE:03:013:C	Everybody wants you
EVE:03:014:C	But I don't like a gold rush
EVE:03:015:V	What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
EVE:03:016:V	With your hair falling into place like dominoes
EVE:03:017:V	I see me padding across your wooden floors
EVE:03:018:V	With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
EVE:03:019:R	At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
EVE:03:020:R	And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it
EVE:03:021:R	And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
EVE:03:022:R	'Cause it could never be
EVE:03:023:C	'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
EVE:03:024:C	I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
EVE:03:025:C	I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
EVE:03:026:C	Everybody wants you
EVE:03:027:C	Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
EVE:03:028:C	Walk past, quick brush
EVE:03:029:C	I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
EVE:03:030:C	I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
EVE:03:031:C	Everybody wants you
EVE:03:032:C	But I don't like a gold rush
EVE:03:033:V	What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
EVE:03:034:V	With your hair falling into place like dominoes
EVE:03:035:V	My mind turns your life into folklore
EVE:03:036:V	I can't dare to dream about you anymore
EVE:03:037:R	At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
EVE:03:038:R	And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
EVE:03:039:R	'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
EVE:03:040:R	'Cause it will never be
EVE:03:041:I	Gleaming, twinkling
EVE:03:042:I	Eyes like sinking
EVE:03:043:I	Ships on waters
EVE:03:044:I	So inviting, I almost jump in
EVE:04:001:V	If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
EVE:04:002:V	While I was gone, I would've asked you
EVE:04:003:V	It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
EVE:04:004:V	But I felt it when I passed you
EVE:04:005:V	There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
EVE:04:006:V	But if it's all the same to you
EVE:04:007:V	It's the same to me
EVE:04:008:C	So we could call it even
EVE:04:009:C	You could call me "babe" for the weekend
EVE:04:010:C	'Tis the damn season, write this down
EVE:04:011:C	I'm stayin' at my parents' house
EVE:04:012:C	And the road not taken looks real good now
EVE:04:013:C	And it always leads to you and my hometown
EVE:04:014:V	I parked my car right between the Methodist
EVE:04:015:V	And the school that used to be ours
EVE:04:016:V	The holidays linger like bad perfume
EVE:04:017:V	You can run, but only so far
EVE:04:018:V	I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
EVE:04:019:V	But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me
EVE:04:020:C	We could call it even
EVE:04:021:C	You could call me "babe" for the weekend
EVE:04:022:C	'Tis the damn season, write this down
EVE:04:023:C	I'm stayin' at my parents' house
EVE:04:024:C	And the road not taken looks real good now
EVE:04:025:C	Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
EVE:04:026:C	Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
EVE:04:027:C	We could just ride around
EVE:04:028:C	And the road not taken looks real good now
EVE:04:029:C	And it always leads to you and my hometown
EVE:04:030:B	Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
EVE:04:031:B	I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
EVE:04:032:B	So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
EVE:04:033:B	Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
EVE:04:034:B	And wonder about the only soul
EVE:04:035:B	Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
EVE:04:036:B	And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
EVE:04:037:B	To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
EVE:04:038:B	We could call it even
EVE:04:039:B	Even though I'm leaving
EVE:04:040:B	And I'll be yours for the weekend
EVE:04:041:B	'Tis the damn season
EVE:04:042:C	We could call it even
EVE:04:043:C	You could call me "babe" for the weekend
EVE:04:044:C	'Tis the damn season, write this down
EVE:04:045:C	I'm stayin' at my parents' house
EVE:04:046:C	And the road not taken looks real good now
EVE:04:047:C	Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
EVE:04:048:C	Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
EVE:04:049:C	We could just ride around
EVE:04:050:C	And the road not taken looks real good now
EVE:04:051:C	And it always leads to you and my hometown
EVE:04:052:I	It always leads to you and my hometown
EVE:05:001:V	I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
EVE:05:002:V	I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
EVE:05:003:V	I sit and watch you
EVE:05:004:V	I notice everything you do or don't do
EVE:05:005:V	You're so much older and wiser, and I
EVE:05:006:C	I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
EVE:05:007:C	Use my best colors for your portrait
EVE:05:008:C	Lay the table with the fancy shit
EVE:05:009:C	And watch you tolerate it
EVE:05:010:C	If it's all in my head, tell me now
EVE:05:011:C	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
EVE:05:012:C	I know my love should be celebrated
EVE:05:013:C	But you tolerate it
EVE:05:014:V	I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
EVE:05:015:V	I take your indiscretions all in good fun
EVE:05:016:V	I sit and listen
EVE:05:017:V	I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
EVE:05:018:V	You're so much older and wiser, and I
EVE:05:019:C	I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
EVE:05:020:C	Use my best colors for your portrait
EVE:05:021:C	Lay the table with the fancy shit
EVE:05:022:C	And watch you tolerate it
EVE:05:023:C	If it's all in my head, tell me now
EVE:05:024:C	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
EVE:05:025:C	I know my love should be celebrated
EVE:05:026:C	But you tolerate it
EVE:05:027:B	While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
EVE:05:028:B	Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
EVE:05:029:B	I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
EVE:05:030:B	Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
EVE:05:031:B	Drawin' hearts in the byline
EVE:05:032:B	Always takin' up too much space or time
EVE:05:033:B	You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)
EVE:05:034:C	Break free and leave us in ruins?
EVE:05:035:C	Took this dagger in me and removed it
EVE:05:036:C	Gain the weight of you, then lose it
EVE:05:037:C	Believe me, I could do it
EVE:05:038:C	If it's all in my head, tell me now
EVE:05:039:C	Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
EVE:05:040:C	I know my love should be celebrated
EVE:05:041:C	But you tolerate it
EVE:05:042:I	I sit and watch you
EVE:06:001:I	He did it
EVE:06:002:I	He did it
EVE:06:003:V	Este's a friend of mine
EVE:06:004:V	We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
EVE:06:005:V	Este's been losin' sleep
EVE:06:006:V	Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity
EVE:06:007:V	She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
EVE:06:008:V	That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
EVE:06:009:V	No, there ain't no doubt
EVE:06:010:V	I think I'm gonna call him out
EVE:06:011:C	She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
EVE:06:012:C	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
EVE:06:013:C	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
EVE:06:014:C	No, no body, no crime
EVE:06:015:C	But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
EVE:06:016:C	No, no
EVE:06:017:C	I think he did it
EVE:06:018:C	No, no
EVE:06:019:C	He did it
EVE:06:020:V	Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive-Garden
EVE:06:021:V	At her job or anywhere
EVE:06:022:V	He reports his missing wife
EVE:06:023:V	And I noticed when I passed his house
EVE:06:024:V	His truck has got some brand new tires
EVE:06:025:V	And his mistress moved in
EVE:06:026:V	Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
EVE:06:027:V	No, there ain't no doubt
EVE:06:028:V	Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause
EVE:06:029:C	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
EVE:06:030:C	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
EVE:06:031:C	I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
EVE:06:032:C	No, no body, no crime
EVE:06:033:C	But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
EVE:06:034:C	No, no
EVE:06:035:C	I think he did it
EVE:06:036:C	No, no
EVE:06:037:C	He did it
EVE:06:038:B	Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
EVE:06:039:B	And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
EVE:06:040:B	Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me (She was with me, dude)
EVE:06:041:B	Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
EVE:06:042:C	They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
EVE:06:043:C	They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
EVE:06:044:C	She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it
EVE:06:045:I	No, no body, no crime
EVE:06:046:I	I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
EVE:06:047:I	No, no body, no crime
EVE:06:048:I	I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
EVE:06:049:I	No, no body, no crime
EVE:06:050:I	I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died
EVE:07:001:V	Honey, when I'm above the trees
EVE:07:002:V	I see this for what it is
EVE:07:003:V	But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
EVE:07:004:V	Is just shit we're dividin' up
EVE:07:005:V	Showed you all of my hiding spots
EVE:07:006:V	I was dancing when the music stopped
EVE:07:007:V	And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
EVE:07:008:V	I haven't met the new me yet
EVE:07:009:C	There'll be happiness after you
EVE:07:010:C	But there was happiness because of you
EVE:07:011:C	Both of these things can be true
EVE:07:012:C	There is happiness
EVE:07:013:C	Past the blood and bruise
EVE:07:014:C	Past the curses and cries
EVE:07:015:C	Beyond the terror in the nightfall
EVE:07:016:C	Haunted by the look in my eyes
EVE:07:017:C	That would've loved you for a lifetime
EVE:07:018:C	Leave it all behind
EVE:07:019:C	And there is happiness
EVE:07:020:V	Tell me, when did your winning smile
EVE:07:021:V	Begin to look like a smirk?
EVE:07:022:V	When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
EVE:07:023:V	Pointed at my deepest hurt?
EVE:07:024:V	I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
EVE:07:025:V	Who takes my spot next to you
EVE:07:026:V	No, I didn't mean that
EVE:07:027:V	Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
EVE:07:028:V	You haven't met the new me yet
EVE:07:029:C	There'll be happiness after me
EVE:07:030:C	But there was happiness because of me
EVE:07:031:C	Both of these things, I believe
EVE:07:032:C	There is happiness
EVE:07:033:C	In our history, across our great divide
EVE:07:034:C	There is a glorious sunrise
EVE:07:035:C	Dappled with the flickers of light
EVE:07:036:C	From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
EVE:07:037:C	And there is happiness
EVE:07:038:B	I can't make it go away by making you a villain
EVE:07:039:B	I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
EVE:07:040:B	And I pulled your body into mine
EVE:07:041:B	Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
EVE:07:042:B	No one teaches you what to do
EVE:07:043:B	When a good man hurts you
EVE:07:044:B	And you know you hurt him too
EVE:07:045:V	Honey, when I'm above the trees
EVE:07:046:V	I see it for what it is
EVE:07:047:V	But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
EVE:07:048:V	After giving you the best I had
EVE:07:049:V	Tell me what to give after that
EVE:07:050:V	All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
EVE:07:051:V	You haven't met the new me yet
EVE:07:052:V	And I think she'll give you that
EVE:07:053:C	There'll be happiness after you
EVE:07:054:C	But there was happiness because of you too
EVE:07:055:C	Both of these things can be true
EVE:07:056:C	There is happiness
EVE:07:057:C	In our history, across our great divide
EVE:07:058:C	There is a glorious sunrise
EVE:07:059:C	Dappled with the flickers of light
EVE:07:060:C	From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
EVE:07:061:C	Oh, leave it all behind
EVE:07:062:C	Leave it all behind
EVE:07:063:C	And there is happiness
EVE:08:001:V	Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
EVE:08:002:V	When we were younger, down in the park
EVE:08:003:V	Honey, makin' a lark of the misery
EVE:08:004:V	You got shiny friends since you left town
EVE:08:005:V	A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
EVE:08:006:V	And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya
EVE:08:007:C	Ooh
EVE:08:008:C	This place is the same as it ever was
EVE:08:009:C	Ooh
EVE:08:010:C	But you won't like it that way
EVE:08:011:C	It's never too late to come back to my side
EVE:08:012:C	The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
EVE:08:013:C	And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
EVE:08:014:C	You know that you'll always know me
EVE:08:015:C	Dorothea, uh-uh
EVE:08:016:C	Dorothea, ah-ah
EVE:08:017:C	Ooh
EVE:08:018:C	You're a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
EVE:08:019:C	Ooh
EVE:08:020:C	From you, I'd buy anything
EVE:08:021:V	Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
EVE:08:022:V	When it was calmer, skippin' the prom
EVE:08:023:V	Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
EVE:08:024:V	And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
EVE:08:025:V	But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
EVE:08:026:C	Ooh
EVE:08:027:C	I guess I'll never know
EVE:08:028:C	Ooh
EVE:08:029:C	And you'll go on with the show
EVE:08:030:C	But it's never too late to come back to my side
EVE:08:031:C	The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
EVE:08:032:C	And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
EVE:08:033:C	You know, you'll always know me
EVE:08:034:C	Dorothea, uh-uh
EVE:08:035:C	Dorothea, ah-ah
EVE:08:036:I	Ooh, ooh
EVE:08:037:I	Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
EVE:08:038:I	Ooh, ooh
EVE:08:039:I	Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
EVE:08:040:I	Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
EVE:08:041:I	Ah-ah
EVE:08:042:I	Ooh
EVE:09:001:V	Break my soul in two looking for you
EVE:09:002:V	But you're right here
EVE:09:003:V	If I can't relate to you anymore
EVE:09:004:V	Then who am I related to?
EVE:09:005:V	And if this is the long haul
EVE:09:006:V	How'd we get here so soon?
EVE:09:007:V	Did I close my fist around something delicate?
EVE:09:008:V	Did I shatter you?
EVE:09:009:C	And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney-Island
EVE:09:010:C	Wondering, where did my baby go?
EVE:09:011:C	The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
EVE:09:012:C	Sorry for not making you my centerfold
EVE:09:013:C	Over and over
EVE:09:014:C	Lost again with no surprises
EVE:09:015:C	Disappointments, close your eyes
EVE:09:016:C	And it gets colder and colder
EVE:09:017:C	When the sun goes down
EVE:09:018:V	The question pounds my head
EVE:09:019:V	What's a lifetime of achievement
EVE:09:020:V	If I pushed you to the edge
EVE:09:021:V	But you were too polite to leave me?
EVE:09:022:V	And do you miss the rogue
EVE:09:023:V	Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
EVE:09:024:V	Will you forgive my soul
EVE:09:025:V	When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
EVE:09:026:C	'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
EVE:09:027:C	It was the one place to be
EVE:09:028:C	The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
EVE:09:029:C	Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
EVE:09:030:C	Over and over
EVE:09:031:C	Lost again with no surprises
EVE:09:032:C	Disappointments, close your eyes
EVE:09:033:C	And it gets colder and colder
EVE:09:034:C	When the sun goes down
EVE:09:035:B	Were you waiting at our old spot
EVE:09:036:B	In the tree line by the gold clock
EVE:09:037:B	Did I leave you hanging every single day?
EVE:09:038:B	Were you standing in the hallway
EVE:09:039:B	With a big cake, happy birthday
EVE:09:040:B	Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
EVE:09:041:B	A universe away
EVE:09:042:B	And when I got into the accident
EVE:09:043:B	The sight that flashed before me was your face
EVE:09:044:B	But when I walked up to the podium
EVE:09:045:B	I think that I forgot to say your name
EVE:09:046:C	I'm on a bench in Coney-Island
EVE:09:047:C	Wondering, where did my baby go?
EVE:09:048:C	The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
EVE:09:049:C	Sorry for not making you my centerfold
EVE:09:050:C	Over and over
EVE:09:051:C	Lost again with no surprises
EVE:09:052:C	Disappointments, close your eyes
EVE:09:053:C	And it gets colder and colder
EVE:09:054:C	When the sun goes down
EVE:09:055:I	When the sun goes down
EVE:09:056:I	The sight that flashed before me was your face
EVE:09:057:I	When the sun goes down
EVE:09:058:I	But I think that I forgot to say your name
EVE:09:059:I	Over and over
EVE:09:060:I	Sorry for not making you my, making you my
EVE:09:061:I	Making you my centerfold
EVE:10:001:V	How's one to know?
EVE:10:002:V	I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
EVE:10:003:V	In a faith-forgotten land
EVE:10:004:V	In from the snow
EVE:10:005:V	Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
EVE:10:006:V	Tarnished but so grand
EVE:10:007:C	And the old widow goes to the stone every day
EVE:10:008:C	But I don't, I just sit here and wait
EVE:10:009:C	Grieving for the living
EVE:10:010:C	Oh, goddamn
EVE:10:011:C	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
EVE:10:012:C	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
EVE:10:013:C	Oh, I can't
EVE:10:014:C	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
EVE:10:015:C	My house of stone, your ivy grows
EVE:10:016:C	And now I'm covered in you
EVE:10:017:V	I wish to know
EVE:10:018:V	The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
EVE:10:019:V	Magnificently cursed
EVE:10:020:V	He's in the room
EVE:10:021:V	Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
EVE:10:022:V	He wants what's only yours
EVE:10:023:C	Oh, goddamn
EVE:10:024:C	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
EVE:10:025:C	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
EVE:10:026:C	Oh, I can't
EVE:10:027:C	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
EVE:10:028:C	My house of stone, your ivy grows
EVE:10:029:C	And now I'm covered
EVE:10:030:V	Clover blooms in the fields
EVE:10:031:V	Spring breaks loose, the time is near
EVE:10:032:V	What would he do if he found us out?
EVE:10:033:V	Crescent moon, coast is clear
EVE:10:034:V	Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
EVE:10:035:V	He's gonna burn this house to the ground
EVE:10:036:V	How's one to know?
EVE:10:037:V	I'd live and die for moments that we stole
EVE:10:038:V	On begged and borrowed time
EVE:10:039:V	So tell me to run
EVE:10:040:V	Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
EVE:10:041:V	And drink my husband's wine
EVE:10:042:C	Oh, goddamn
EVE:10:043:C	My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
EVE:10:044:C	Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
EVE:10:045:C	Oh, I can't
EVE:10:046:C	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
EVE:10:047:C	My house of stone, your ivy grows
EVE:10:048:C	And now I'm covered in you
EVE:10:049:C	And I'm covered in you
EVE:10:050:B	So yeah, it's a fire
EVE:10:051:B	It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
EVE:10:052:B	And you started it
EVE:10:053:B	You started it
EVE:10:054:B	So yeah, it's a war
EVE:10:055:B	It's the goddamn fight of my life
EVE:10:056:B	And you started it
EVE:10:057:B	You started it
EVE:10:058:C	Oh, I can't
EVE:10:059:C	Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
EVE:10:060:C	My house of stone, your ivy grows
EVE:10:061:C	And now I'm covered
EVE:10:062:C	In you, in you
EVE:10:063:C	Now I'm covered in you
EVE:10:064:C	In you
EVE:11:001:V	And the tennis court was covered up
EVE:11:002:V	With some tent-like thing
EVE:11:003:V	And you asked me to dance
EVE:11:004:V	But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"
EVE:11:005:V	Oh, I thought
EVE:11:006:V	This is gonna be one of those things
EVE:11:007:V	Now I know
EVE:11:008:V	I'm never gonna love again
EVE:11:009:R	I've got some tricks up my sleeve
EVE:11:010:R	Takes one to know one
EVE:11:011:R	You're a cowboy like me
EVE:11:012:V	Never wanted love
EVE:11:013:V	Just a fancy car
EVE:11:014:V	Now I'm waiting by the phone
EVE:11:015:V	Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
EVE:11:016:R	You had some tricks up your sleeve
EVE:11:017:R	Takes one to know one
EVE:11:018:R	You're a cowboy like me
EVE:11:019:C	Perched in the dark
EVE:11:020:C	Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
EVE:11:021:C	Like it could be love
EVE:11:022:C	I could be the way forward
EVE:11:023:C	Only if they pay for it
EVE:11:024:C	You're a bandit like me
EVE:11:025:C	Eyes full of stars
EVE:11:026:C	Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
EVE:11:027:C	It could be love
EVE:11:028:C	We could be the way forward
EVE:11:029:C	And I know I'll pay for it
EVE:11:030:C	You're a cowboy like me
EVE:11:031:C	Perched in the dark
EVE:11:032:C	Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
EVE:11:033:C	Like it could be love
EVE:11:034:C	I could be the way forward
EVE:11:035:C	Only if they pay for it
EVE:11:036:C	You're a bandit like me
EVE:11:037:C	Eyes full of stars
EVE:11:038:C	Hustlin' for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
EVE:11:039:C	It could be love
EVE:11:040:C	We could be the way forward
EVE:11:041:C	And I know I'll pay for it
EVE:11:042:B	And the skeletons in both our closets
EVE:11:043:B	Plotted hard to fuck this up
EVE:11:044:B	And the old men that I've swindled
EVE:11:045:B	Really did believe I was the one
EVE:11:046:B	And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about
EVE:11:047:B	When you passed through town
EVE:11:048:B	Oh, but that was all before I locked it down
EVE:11:049:V	Now you hang from my lips
EVE:11:050:V	Like the Gardens-of-Babylon
EVE:11:051:V	With your boots beneath my bed
EVE:11:052:V	Forever is the sweetest con
EVE:11:053:R	I've had some tricks up my sleeve
EVE:11:054:R	Takes one to know one
EVE:11:055:R	You're a cowboy like me
EVE:11:056:I	And I'm never gonna love again
EVE:11:057:I	I'm never gonna love again
EVE:11:058:I	I'm never gonna love again
EVE:12:001:V	Fatefully
EVE:12:002:V	I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
EVE:12:003:V	Misery
EVE:12:004:V	Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
EVE:12:005:V	And you passed right by
EVE:12:006:V	I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
EVE:12:007:V	The knife cuts both ways
EVE:12:008:V	If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
EVE:12:009:C	And I fell from the pedestal
EVE:12:010:C	Right down the rabbit hole
EVE:12:011:C	Long story short, it was a bad time
EVE:12:012:C	Pushed from the precipice
EVE:12:013:C	Clung to the nearest lips
EVE:12:014:C	Long story short, it was the wrong guy
EVE:12:015:C	Now I'm all about you
EVE:12:016:C	I'm all about you, ah
EVE:12:017:C	Yeah, yeah
EVE:12:018:C	I'm all about you, ah
EVE:12:019:C	Yeah, yeah
EVE:12:020:V	Actually
EVE:12:021:V	I always felt I must look better in the rear view
EVE:12:022:V	Missing me
EVE:12:023:V	At the golden gates they once held the keys to
EVE:12:024:V	When I dropped my sword
EVE:12:025:V	I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
EVE:12:026:V	And we live in peace
EVE:12:027:V	But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
EVE:12:028:C	'Cause I fell from the pedestal
EVE:12:029:C	Right down the rabbit hole
EVE:12:030:C	Long story short, it was a bad time
EVE:12:031:C	Pushed from the precipice
EVE:12:032:C	Clung to the nearest lips
EVE:12:033:C	Long story short, it was the wrong guy
EVE:12:034:C	Now I'm all about you
EVE:12:035:C	I'm all about you, ah
EVE:12:036:C	Yeah, yeah
EVE:12:037:C	I'm all about you
EVE:12:038:B	No more keepin' score
EVE:12:039:B	Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
EVE:12:040:B	No more tug of war
EVE:12:041:B	Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
EVE:12:042:B	No more keepin' score
EVE:12:043:B	Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
EVE:12:044:B	And my waves meet your shore
EVE:12:045:B	Ever and evermore
EVE:12:046:V	Past me
EVE:12:047:V	I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
EVE:12:048:V	Your nemeses
EVE:12:049:V	Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
EVE:12:050:V	And he's passing by
EVE:12:051:V	Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
EVE:12:052:V	And he feels like home
EVE:12:053:V	If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
EVE:12:054:C	And I fell from the pedestal
EVE:12:055:C	Right down the rabbit hole
EVE:12:056:C	Long story short, it was a bad time
EVE:12:057:C	Pushed from the precipice
EVE:12:058:C	Climbed right back up the cliff
EVE:12:059:C	Long story short, I survived
EVE:12:060:C	Now I'm all about you
EVE:12:061:C	(And now) I'm all about you, ah
EVE:12:062:C	(And now) I'm all about you
EVE:12:063:C	(And now) I'm all about you, ah
EVE:12:064:C	Yeah, yeah
EVE:12:065:C	I'm all about you
EVE:12:066:C	(And now) Yeah, yeah
EVE:12:067:C	I'm all about you
EVE:12:068:I	Long story short, it was a bad time
EVE:12:069:I	Long story short, I survived
EVE:13:001:V	Never be so kind
EVE:13:002:V	You forget to be clever
EVE:13:003:V	Never be so clever
EVE:13:004:V	You forget to be kind
EVE:13:005:C	And if I didn't know better
EVE:13:006:C	I'd think you were talking to me now
EVE:13:007:C	If I didn't know better
EVE:13:008:C	I'd think you were still around
EVE:13:009:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:010:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:011:C	You're alive, you're alive in my head
EVE:13:012:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:013:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:014:C	You're alive, so alive
EVE:13:015:V	Never be so polite
EVE:13:016:V	You forget your power
EVE:13:017:V	Never wield such power
EVE:13:018:V	You forget to be polite
EVE:13:019:C	And if I didn't know better
EVE:13:020:C	I'd think you were listening to me now
EVE:13:021:C	If I didn't know better
EVE:13:022:C	I'd think you were still around
EVE:13:023:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:024:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:025:C	You're alive, you're alive in my head
EVE:13:026:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:027:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:028:C	You're alive, so alive
EVE:13:029:B	The autumn chill that wakes me up
EVE:13:030:B	You loved the amber skies so much
EVE:13:031:B	Long limbs and frozen swims
EVE:13:032:B	You'd always go past where our feet could touch
EVE:13:033:B	And I complained the whole way there
EVE:13:034:B	The car ride back and up the stairs
EVE:13:035:B	I should've asked you questions
EVE:13:036:B	I should've asked you how to be
EVE:13:037:B	Asked you to write it down for me
EVE:13:038:B	Should've kept every grocery store receipt
EVE:13:039:B	'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
EVE:13:040:B	Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
EVE:13:041:B	All your closets of backlogged dreams
EVE:13:042:B	And how you left them all to me
EVE:13:043:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:044:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:045:C	You're alive, you're alive in my head
EVE:13:046:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:047:C	What died didn't stay dead
EVE:13:048:C	You're alive, so alive
EVE:13:049:I	And if I didn't know better
EVE:13:050:I	I'd think you were singing to me now
EVE:13:051:I	If I didn't know better
EVE:13:052:I	I'd think you were still around
EVE:13:053:I	I know better
EVE:13:054:I	But I still feel you all around
EVE:13:055:I	I know better
EVE:13:056:I	But you're still around
EVE:14:001:V	It's been a long time
EVE:14:002:V	And seeing the shape of your name
EVE:14:003:V	Still spells out pain
EVE:14:004:V	It wasn't right
EVE:14:005:V	The way it all went down
EVE:14:006:V	Looks like you know that now
EVE:14:007:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:008:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:009:C	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
EVE:14:010:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:011:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:012:C	I know that it's over, I don't need your
EVE:14:013:C	Closure, your closure
EVE:14:014:V	Don't treat me like
EVE:14:015:V	Some situation that needs to be handled
EVE:14:016:V	I'm fine with my spite
EVE:14:017:V	And my tears and my beers and my candles
EVE:14:018:V	I can feel you smoothing me over
EVE:14:019:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:020:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:021:C	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
EVE:14:022:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:023:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:024:C	I know that it's over, I don't need your
EVE:14:025:C	Closure, your closure
EVE:14:026:C	Your closure, your closure
EVE:14:027:B	I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
EVE:14:028:B	Staying friends would iron it out so nice
EVE:14:029:B	Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
EVE:14:030:B	That you put between you and me
EVE:14:031:B	But it's fake and it's oh-so unnecessary
EVE:14:032:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:033:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:034:C	It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
EVE:14:035:C	Yes, I got your letter
EVE:14:036:C	Yes, I'm doing better
EVE:14:037:C	I know that it's over, I don't need your
EVE:14:038:C	Closure, closure, your closure
EVE:14:039:C	Your closure
EVE:15:001:V	Gray November
EVE:15:002:V	I've been down since July
EVE:15:003:V	Motion capture
EVE:15:004:V	Put me in a bad light
EVE:15:005:V	I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
EVE:15:006:V	Trying to find the one where I went wrong
EVE:15:007:V	Writing letters
EVE:15:008:V	Addressed to the fire
EVE:15:009:C	And I was catchin' my breath
EVE:15:010:C	Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
EVE:15:011:C	And I couldn't be sure
EVE:15:012:C	I had a feeling so peculiar
EVE:15:013:C	That this pain would be for
EVE:15:014:C	Evermore
EVE:15:015:V	Hey, December
EVE:15:016:V	Guess I'm feeling unmoored
EVE:15:017:V	Can't remember
EVE:15:018:V	What I used to fight for
EVE:15:019:V	I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause
EVE:15:020:V	On the very moment all was lost
EVE:15:021:V	Sending signals
EVE:15:022:V	To be double-crossed
EVE:15:023:C	And I was catchin' my breath
EVE:15:024:C	Barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death
EVE:15:025:C	And I couldn't be sure
EVE:15:026:C	I had a feeling so peculiar
EVE:15:027:C	That this pain would be for
EVE:15:028:C	Evermore
EVE:15:029:C	(Evermore)
EVE:15:030:B	Can't not think of all the cost
EVE:15:031:B	And the things that will be lost
EVE:15:032:B	Oh, can we just get a pause?
EVE:15:033:B	To be certain we'll be tall again
EVE:15:034:B	Whether weather be the frost
EVE:15:035:B	Or the violence of the dog days
EVE:15:036:B	I'm on waves, out being tossed
EVE:15:037:B	Is there a line that I could just go cross?
EVE:15:038:B	And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
EVE:15:039:B	I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
EVE:15:040:B	In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
EVE:15:041:B	I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
EVE:15:042:B	(If you think of all the cost)
EVE:15:043:B	It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
EVE:15:044:B	To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
EVE:15:045:B	(Or the violence of the dog days)
EVE:15:046:B	(Out on waves, being tossed)
EVE:15:047:B	(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
EVE:15:048:B	But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
EVE:15:049:B	You were there
EVE:15:050:C	And I was catchin' my breath
EVE:15:051:C	Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step
EVE:15:052:C	And I couldn't be sure
EVE:15:053:C	I had a feeling so peculiar
EVE:15:054:C	This pain wouldn't be for
EVE:15:055:C	Evermore
EVE:15:056:I	Evermore (Evermore)
EVE:15:057:I	Evermore (Evermore)
EVE:15:058:I	This pain wouldn't be for evermore
EVE:15:059:I	Evermore
EVE:16:001:V	Friends break up, friends get married
EVE:16:002:V	Strangers get born, strangers get buried
EVE:16:003:V	Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
EVE:16:004:V	But I'm right where you left me
EVE:16:005:V	Matches burn after the other
EVE:16:006:V	Pages turn and stick to each other
EVE:16:007:V	Wages earned and lessons learned
EVE:16:008:V	But I, I'm right where you left me
EVE:16:009:C	Help, I'm still at the restaurant
EVE:16:010:C	Still sitting in a corner I haunt
EVE:16:011:C	Cross-legged in the dim light
EVE:16:012:C	They say, "What a sad sight," I
EVE:16:013:C	I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
EVE:16:014:C	Right when I felt the moment stop
EVE:16:015:C	Glass shattered on the white cloth
EVE:16:016:C	Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
EVE:16:017:C	Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
EVE:16:018:C	They expected me to find somewhere
EVE:16:019:C	Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where
EVE:16:020:C	You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
EVE:16:021:C	You left me no choice but to stay here forever
EVE:16:022:C	You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
EVE:16:023:C	You left me no choice but to stay here forever
EVE:16:024:B	Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
EVE:16:025:B	Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
EVE:16:026:B	She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
EVE:16:027:B	How it was supposed to be
EVE:16:028:B	Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
EVE:16:029:B	Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
EVE:16:030:B	She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
EVE:16:031:B	And you're sitting in front of me
EVE:16:032:C	At the restaurant
EVE:16:033:C	When I was still the one you want
EVE:16:034:C	Cross-legged in the dim light
EVE:16:035:C	Everything was just right, I
EVE:16:036:C	I could feel the mascara run
EVE:16:037:C	You told me that you met someone
EVE:16:038:C	Glass shattered on the white cloth
EVE:16:039:C	Everybody moved on
EVE:16:040:C	Help, I'm still at the restaurant
EVE:16:041:C	Still sitting in a corner I haunt
EVE:16:042:C	Cross-legged in the dim light
EVE:16:043:C	They say, "What a sad sight," I, I stayed there
EVE:16:044:C	Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
EVE:16:045:C	I'm sure that you got a wife out there
EVE:16:046:C	Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware 'cause I'm right where
EVE:16:047:C	I cause no harm, mind my business
EVE:16:048:C	If our love died young, I can't bear witness, and it's been so long
EVE:16:049:C	If you ever think you got it wrong, I'm right where
EVE:16:050:C	You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
EVE:16:051:C	You left me no choice but to stay here forever
EVE:16:052:C	You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
EVE:16:053:C	You left me no choice but to stay here forever
EVE:17:001:V	When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
EVE:17:002:V	You ask for the tab
EVE:17:003:V	Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
EVE:17:004:V	Look at each other like that
EVE:17:005:V	When the words of a sister come back in whispers
EVE:17:006:V	That prove she was not
EVE:17:007:V	In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
EVE:17:008:V	She's a crook who was caught
EVE:17:009:C	That old familiar body ache
EVE:17:010:C	The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
EVE:17:011:C	You know when it's time to go
EVE:17:012:V	Twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
EVE:17:013:V	Gets the spot that was yours
EVE:17:014:V	Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
EVE:17:015:V	Will only break their hearts worse
EVE:17:016:C	That old familiar body ache
EVE:17:017:C	The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
EVE:17:018:C	You know when it's time to go
EVE:17:019:C	Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
EVE:17:020:C	Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
EVE:17:021:C	Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
EVE:17:022:C	That will find you the right thing
EVE:17:023:C	Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
EVE:17:024:C	Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
EVE:17:025:C	Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
EVE:17:026:C	That will find you the right thing
EVE:17:027:V	Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
EVE:17:028:V	Begging 'til my knees bled
EVE:17:029:V	I gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all
EVE:17:030:V	Then wondered why I left
EVE:17:031:V	Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
EVE:17:032:V	Praying to his greed
EVE:17:033:V	He's got my past frozen behind glass
EVE:17:034:V	But I've got me
EVE:17:035:C	That old familiar body ache
EVE:17:036:C	The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
EVE:17:037:C	I know when it's time to go
EVE:17:038:C	Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
EVE:17:039:C	Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
EVE:17:040:C	Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
EVE:17:041:C	That will find you the right thing
EVE:17:042:C	Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
EVE:17:043:C	Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
EVE:17:044:C	Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
EVE:17:045:C	That will find you the right thing
EVE:17:046:I	That will find you the right thing
EVE:17:047:I	And you know in your soul
EVE:17:048:I	And you know in your soul
EVE:17:049:I	When it's time to go
EVE:17:050:I	And, well, you know, you know, you know, you know
EVE:17:051:I	When it's time to go
EVE:17:052:I	So then you go and then you go
EVE:17:053:I	You just go
MID:01:001:I	Meet me at midnight
MID:01:002:V	Staring at the ceiling with you
MID:01:003:V	Oh, you don't ever say too much
MID:01:004:V	And you don't really read into
MID:01:005:V	My melancholia
MID:01:006:C	I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:007:C	You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:008:C	All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:009:C	I feel
MID:01:010:C	The lavender haze creeping up on me
MID:01:011:C	Surreal
MID:01:012:C	I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
MID:01:013:C	No deal
MID:01:014:C	The 1950s shit they want from me
MID:01:015:C	I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
MID:01:016:V	All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
MID:01:017:V	Is if I'm gonna be your bride
MID:01:018:V	The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
MID:01:019:V	Is a one-night or a wife
MID:01:020:C	I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:021:C	They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:022:C	But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
MID:01:023:C	I feel
MID:01:024:C	The lavender haze creepin' up on me
MID:01:025:C	Surreal
MID:01:026:C	I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
MID:01:027:C	No deal
MID:01:028:C	The 1950s shit they want from me
MID:01:029:C	I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
MID:01:030:C	That lavender haze
MID:01:031:B	Talk your talk and go viral
MID:01:032:B	I just need this love spiral
MID:01:033:B	Get it off your chest
MID:01:034:B	Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
MID:01:035:B	Talk your talk and go viral
MID:01:036:B	I just need this love spiral
MID:01:037:B	Get it off your chest
MID:01:038:B	Get it off my desk
MID:01:039:C	I feel (I feel)
MID:01:040:C	The lavender haze creeping up on me
MID:01:041:C	Surreal
MID:01:042:C	I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
MID:01:043:C	No deal (No deal)
MID:01:044:C	The 1950s shit they want from me

MID:01:048:I	That lavender haze
MID:01:049:I	I just wanna stay
MID:01:050:I	I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
MID:02:001:V	When the morning came
MID:02:002:V	We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
MID:02:003:V	'Cause we lost track of time again
MID:02:004:V	Laughing with my feet in your lap
MID:02:005:V	Like you were my closest friend
MID:02:006:V	"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
MID:02:007:V	"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
MID:02:008:V	I see you every day now
MID:02:009:C	And I chose you
MID:02:010:C	The one I was dancing with
MID:02:011:C	In New-York, no shoes
MID:02:012:C	Looked up at the sky and it was
MID:02:013:C	The burgundy on my t-shirt
MID:02:014:C	When you splashed your wine into me
MID:02:015:C	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
MID:02:016:C	So scarlet, it was
MID:02:017:C	The mark they saw on my collarbone
MID:02:018:C	The rust that grew between telephones
MID:02:019:C	The lips I used to call home
MID:02:020:C	So scarlet, it was maroon
MID:02:021:V	When the silence came
MID:02:022:V	We were shaking, blind and hazy
MID:02:023:V	How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
MID:02:024:V	Sobbing with your head in your hands
MID:02:025:V	Ain't that the way shit always ends?
MID:02:026:V	You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
MID:02:027:V	Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
MID:02:028:V	I feel you, no matter what
MID:02:029:V	The rubies that I gave up
MID:02:030:C	And I lost you
MID:02:031:C	The one I was dancing with
MID:02:032:C	In New-York, no shoes
MID:02:033:C	Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
MID:02:034:C	The burgundy on my t-shirt
MID:02:035:C	When you splashed your wine into me
MID:02:036:C	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
MID:02:037:C	So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
MID:02:038:C	The mark they saw on my collarbone
MID:02:039:C	The rust that grew between telephones
MID:02:040:C	The lips I used to call home
MID:02:041:C	So scarlet, it was maroon
MID:02:042:B	And I wake with your memory over me
MID:02:043:B	That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
MID:02:044:B	And I wake with your memory over me
MID:02:045:B	That's a real fucking legacy to leave
MID:02:046:C	The burgundy on my t-shirt
MID:02:047:C	When you splashed your wine into me
MID:02:048:C	And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
MID:02:049:C	So scarlet, it was maroon
MID:02:050:C	The mark they saw on my collarbone
MID:02:051:C	The rust that grew between telephones
MID:02:052:C	The lips I used to call home
MID:02:053:C	So scarlet, it was maroon
MID:02:054:I	It was maroon
MID:02:055:I	It was maroon
MID:03:001:V	I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
MID:03:002:V	Midnights become my afternoons
MID:03:003:V	When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
MID:03:004:V	I've ghosted stand there in the room
MID:03:005:C	I should not be left to my own devices
MID:03:006:C	They come with prices and vices
MID:03:007:C	I end up in crisis
MID:03:008:C	(Tale as old as time)
MID:03:009:C	I wake up screaming from dreaming
MID:03:010:C	One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
MID:03:011:C	'Cause you got tired of my scheming
MID:03:012:C	(For the last time)
MID:03:013:C	It's me, hi
MID:03:014:C	I'm the problem, it's me
MID:03:015:C	At teatime, everybody agrees
MID:03:016:C	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
MID:03:017:C	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
MID:03:018:V	Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
MID:03:019:V	And I'm a monster on the hill
MID:03:020:V	Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
MID:03:021:V	Pierced through the heart, but never killed
MID:03:022:C	Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
MID:03:023:C	Like some kind of congressman?
MID:03:024:C	(A tale as old as time)
MID:03:025:C	I wake up screaming from dreaming
MID:03:026:C	One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
MID:03:027:C	And life will lose all its meaning
MID:03:028:C	(For the last time)
MID:03:029:C	It's me, hi
MID:03:030:C	I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
MID:03:031:C	At teatime, everybody agrees
MID:03:032:C	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
MID:03:033:C	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
MID:03:034:B	I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
MID:03:035:B	She thinks I left them in the will
MID:03:036:B	The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
MID:03:037:B	"She's laughing up at us from Hell"
MID:03:038:B	It's me, hi
MID:03:039:B	I'm the problem, it's me
MID:03:040:B	It's me, hi
MID:03:041:B	I'm the problem, it's me
MID:03:042:B	It's me, hi
MID:03:043:B	Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
MID:03:044:C	It's me, hi (Hi)
MID:03:045:C	I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
MID:03:046:C	At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
MID:03:047:C	I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
MID:03:048:C	It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
MID:05:001:V	Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
MID:05:002:V	I play it cool with the best of them
MID:05:003:V	I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
MID:05:004:V	It's okay, we're the best of friends
MID:05:005:V	Anyway
MID:05:006:V	I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
MID:05:007:V	I touch my phone as if it's your face
MID:05:008:V	I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
MID:05:009:V	There's just one who could make me stay
MID:05:010:V	All my days
MID:05:011:C	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
MID:05:012:C	I waited ages to see you there
MID:05:013:C	I search the party of better bodies
MID:05:014:C	Just to learn that you never cared
MID:05:015:C	You're on your own, kid
MID:05:016:C	You always have been
MID:05:017:V	I see the great escape, so long, Daisy-May
MID:05:018:V	I picked the petals, he loves me not
MID:05:019:V	Something different bloomed, writing in my room
MID:05:020:V	I play my songs in the parking lot
MID:05:021:V	I'll run away
MID:05:022:C	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
MID:05:023:C	I called a taxi to take me there
MID:05:024:C	I search the party of better bodies
MID:05:025:C	Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
MID:05:026:C	You're on your own, kid
MID:05:027:C	You always have been
MID:05:028:B	From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
MID:05:029:B	I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
MID:05:030:B	I hosted parties and starved my body
MID:05:031:B	Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
MID:05:032:B	The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
MID:05:033:B	My friends from home don't know what to say
MID:05:034:B	I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
MID:05:035:B	And I saw something they can't take away
MID:05:036:B	'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
MID:05:037:B	Everything you lose is a step you take
MID:05:038:B	So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
MID:05:039:B	You've got no reason to be afraid
MID:05:040:C	You're on your own, kid
MID:05:041:C	Yeah, you can face this
MID:05:042:C	You're on your own, kid
MID:05:043:C	You always have been
MID:06:001:I	Rain
MID:06:002:I	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
MID:06:003:I	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
MID:06:004:I	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
MID:06:005:I	All of me changed like midnight
MID:06:006:V	My town was a wasteland
MID:06:007:V	Full of cages, full of fences
MID:06:008:V	Pageant queens and big pretenders
MID:06:009:V	But for some, it was paradise
MID:06:010:V	My boy was a montage
MID:06:011:V	A slow-motion, love potion
MID:06:012:V	Jumping off things in the ocean
MID:06:013:V	I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
MID:06:014:V	He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
MID:06:015:C	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
MID:06:016:C	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
MID:06:017:C	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
MID:06:018:C	All of me changed like midnight
MID:06:019:V	It came like a postcard
MID:06:020:V	Picture perfect shiny family
MID:06:021:V	Holiday peppermint candy
MID:06:022:V	But for him, it's every day
MID:06:023:V	So I peered through a window
MID:06:024:V	A deep portal, time travel
MID:06:025:V	All the love we unravel
MID:06:026:V	And the life I gave away
MID:06:027:V	'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
MID:06:028:C	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
MID:06:029:C	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
MID:06:030:C	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
MID:06:031:C	All of me changed like midnight rain
MID:06:032:C	He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
MID:06:033:C	He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
MID:06:034:C	Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
MID:06:035:C	All of me changed like midnight
MID:06:036:I	I guess sometimes we all get
MID:06:037:I	Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
MID:06:038:I	And he never thinks of me
MID:06:039:I	Except for when I'm on TV
MID:06:040:I	I guess sometimes we all get
MID:06:041:I	Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
MID:06:042:I	And I never think of him
MID:06:043:I	Except on midnights like this
MID:06:044:I	(Midnights like this, midnights like this)
MID:07:001:I	I remember
MID:07:002:V	Good girl, sad boy
MID:07:003:V	Big city, wrong choices
MID:07:004:V	We had one thing goin' on
MID:07:005:V	I swear that it was somethin'
MID:07:006:V	'Cause I don't remember who I was
MID:07:007:V	Before you painted all my nights
MID:07:008:V	A color I've searched for since
MID:07:009:V	But one thing after another
MID:07:010:V	Fuckin' situations, circumstances
MID:07:011:V	Miscommunications, and I
MID:07:012:V	Have to say, by the way
MID:07:013:V	I just may like some explanations
MID:07:014:C	Can I ask you a question?
MID:07:015:C	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
MID:07:016:C	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
MID:07:017:C	But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
MID:07:018:C	Then what did you do?
MID:07:019:C	Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
MID:07:020:C	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
MID:07:021:C	When she said it was too much?
MID:07:022:C	Do you wish you could still touch her?
MID:07:023:C	It's just a question
MID:07:024:V	Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
MID:07:025:V	Did you realize out of time?
MID:07:026:V	She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
MID:07:027:V	That you saw that night
MID:07:028:V	But you were on somethin'
MID:07:029:V	It was one drink after another
MID:07:030:V	Fuckin' politics and gender roles
MID:07:031:V	And you're not sure and I don't know
MID:07:032:V	Got swept away in the gray
MID:07:033:V	I just may like to have a conversation
MID:07:034:C	Can I ask you a question?
MID:07:035:C	Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
MID:07:036:C	And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
MID:07:037:C	But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
MID:07:038:C	Then what did you do?
MID:07:039:C	Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
MID:07:040:C	Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
MID:07:041:C	When she said it was too much?
MID:07:042:C	Do you wish you could still touch her?
MID:07:043:C	It's just a question
MID:07:044:B	Does it feel like everything's just like
MID:07:045:B	Second best after that meteor strike?
MID:07:046:B	And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
MID:07:047:B	That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
MID:07:048:B	And right, but tonight
MID:07:049:C	Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)

MID:08:001:V	Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
MID:08:002:V	You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
MID:08:003:V	Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
MID:08:004:V	They say looks can kill and I might try
MID:08:005:V	I don't dress for women
MID:08:006:V	I don't dress for men
MID:08:007:V	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
MID:08:008:C	I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
MID:08:009:C	Don't get sad, get even
MID:08:010:C	So on the weekends
MID:08:011:C	I don't dress for friends
MID:08:012:C	Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
MID:08:013:V	She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
MID:08:014:V	She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
MID:08:015:V	Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
MID:08:016:V	Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
MID:08:017:V	And she looks so pretty
MID:08:018:V	Drivin' in your Benz
MID:08:019:V	Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

MID:08:026:B	Ladies know what people want
MID:08:027:B	Someone sweet and kind and fun
MID:08:028:B	The lady simply had enough
MID:08:029:V	While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
MID:08:030:V	Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI

MID:09:001:V	Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
MID:09:002:V	Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
MID:09:003:V	In the shoes I gave you as a present
MID:09:004:V	Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
MID:09:005:V	And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
MID:09:006:C	Best believe I'm still bejeweled
MID:09:007:C	When I walk in the room
MID:09:008:C	I can still make the whole place shimmer
MID:09:009:C	And when I meet the band
MID:09:010:C	They ask, "Do you have a man?"
MID:09:011:C	I could still say, "I don't remember"
MID:09:012:C	Familiarity breeds contempt

MID:09:039:B	Just 'cause he was high
MID:09:040:B	And we're dancin' all night

MID:10:004:V	I'll be gettin' over you my whole life
MID:10:005:C	You know how scared I am of elevators
MID:10:006:C	Never trust it if it rises fast
MID:10:007:C	It can't last
MID:10:008:C	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
MID:10:009:C	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
MID:10:010:C	Oh, I'm fallin' in love

MID:10:012:C	How'd you turn it right around?
MID:10:013:V	It only feels this raw right now
MID:10:014:V	Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
MID:10:015:V	Break up, break free, break through, break down
MID:10:016:V	You would break your back to make me break a smile
MID:10:017:C	You know how much I hate
MID:10:018:C	That everybody just expects me to bounce back
MID:10:019:C	Just like that
MID:10:020:C	Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
MID:10:021:C	Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again

MID:11:001:V	You're talking shit for the hell of it
MID:11:002:V	Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
MID:11:003:V	You're terrified to look down
MID:11:004:V	'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
MID:11:005:V	Of everyone you burned just to get there
MID:11:006:V	It's coming back around
MID:11:007:C	And I keep my side of the street clean

MID:11:018:V	Spiderboy, king of thieves
MID:11:019:V	Weave your little webs of opacity
MID:11:020:V	My pennies made your crown
MID:11:021:V	Trick me once, trick me twice
MID:11:022:V	Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
MID:11:023:V	It's coming back around

MID:12:001:V	I spy with my little tired eye
MID:12:002:V	Tiny as a firefly
MID:12:003:V	A pebble that we picked up last July
MID:12:004:V	Down deep inside your pocket
MID:12:005:V	We almost forgot it
MID:12:006:V	Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
MID:12:007:V	Ooh, ooh
MID:12:008:C	They said the end is comin'
MID:12:009:C	Everyone's up to somethin'
MID:12:010:C	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
MID:12:011:C	Outside, they're push and shovin'
MID:12:012:C	You're in the kitchen hummin'
MID:12:013:C	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
MID:12:014:V	On the way home
MID:12:015:V	I wrote a poem
MID:12:016:V	You say, "What a mind"
MID:12:017:V	This happens all the time
MID:12:018:V	Ooh, ooh
MID:12:019:C	'Cause they said the end is comin'
MID:12:020:C	Everyone's up to somethin'
MID:12:021:C	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
MID:12:022:C	Outside, they're push and shovin'
MID:12:023:C	You're in the kitchen hummin'
MID:12:024:C	All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
MID:12:025:B	Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
MID:12:026:B	And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
MID:12:027:B	And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
MID:12:028:B	To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
MID:12:029:B	Ooh
MID:12:030:C	They said the end is comin'
MID:12:031:C	Everyone's up to somethin'
MID:12:032:C	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
MID:12:033:C	Outside, they're push and shovin'
MID:12:034:C	You're in the kitchen hummin'
MID:12:035:C	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
MID:12:036:C	They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
MID:12:037:C	Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
MID:12:038:C	I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
MID:12:039:C	Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')
MID:12:040:C	You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')
MID:12:041:C	All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
MID:13:001:V	Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
MID:13:002:V	And all the stars aligned
MID:13:003:V	You and I ended up in the same room
MID:13:004:V	At the same time
MID:13:005:C	And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
MID:13:006:C	Of a chain reaction of countermoves
MID:13:007:C	To assess the equation of you
MID:13:008:C	Checkmate, I couldn't lose
MID:13:009:C	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
MID:13:010:C	And the first night that you saw me
MID:13:011:C	Nothing was gonna stop me
MID:13:012:C	I laid the groundwork, and then
MID:13:013:C	Just like clockwork
MID:13:014:C	The dominoes cascaded in a line
MID:13:015:C	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
MID:13:016:C	And now you're mine
MID:13:017:C	It was all by design
MID:13:018:C	'Cause I'm a mastermind
MID:13:019:V	You see, all the wisest women
MID:13:020:V	Had to do it this way
MID:13:021:V	'Cause we were born to be the pawn
MID:13:022:V	In every lover's game
MID:13:023:C	If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
MID:13:024:C	Strategy sets the scene for the tale
MID:13:025:C	I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
MID:13:026:C	And the liquor in our cocktails
MID:13:027:C	What if I told you none of it was accidental?
MID:13:028:C	And the first night that you saw me
MID:13:029:C	I knew I wanted your body
MID:13:030:C	I laid the groundwork, and then
MID:13:031:C	Just like clockwork
MID:13:032:C	The dominoes cascaded in a line
MID:13:033:C	What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
MID:13:034:C	And now you're mine
MID:13:035:C	It was all my design
MID:13:036:C	'Cause I'm a mastermind
MID:13:037:B	No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
MID:13:038:B	So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
MID:13:039:B	To make them love me and make it seem effortless
MID:13:040:B	This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
MID:13:041:B	And I swear
MID:13:042:B	I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
MID:13:043:B	'Cause I care
MID:13:044:C	So I told you none of it was accidental
MID:13:045:C	And the first night that you saw me
MID:13:046:C	Nothing was gonna stop me
MID:13:047:C	I laid the groundwork, and then
MID:13:048:C	Saw a wide smirk on your face
MID:13:049:C	You knew the entire time
MID:13:050:C	You knew that I'm a mastermind
MID:13:051:C	And now you're mine
MID:13:052:C	Yeah, all you did was smile
MID:13:053:C	'Cause I'm a mastermind
MID:14:001:V	My knuckles were bruised like violets
MID:14:002:V	Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
MID:14:003:V	Spineless in my tomb of silence
MID:14:004:V	Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
MID:14:005:V	And maybe it was egos swinging
MID:14:006:V	Maybe it was her
MID:14:007:V	Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
MID:14:008:C	All that bloodshed, crimson clover
MID:14:009:C	Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
MID:14:010:C	My hand was the one you reached for
MID:14:011:C	All throughout the Great-War
MID:14:012:C	Always remember
MID:14:013:C	Uh-huh, tears on the letter
MID:14:014:C	I vowed not to cry anymore
MID:14:015:C	If we survived the Great-War
MID:14:016:V	You drew up some good faith treaties
MID:14:017:V	I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
MID:14:018:V	You said I have to trust more freely
MID:14:019:V	But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
MID:14:020:V	And maybe it's the past that's talking
MID:14:021:V	Screaming from the crypt
MID:14:022:V	Telling me to punish you for things you never did
MID:14:023:V	So I justified it
MID:14:024:C	All that bloodshed, crimson clover
MID:14:025:C	Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
MID:14:026:C	My hand was the one you reached for
MID:14:027:C	All throughout the Great-War
MID:14:028:C	Always remember
MID:14:029:C	Uh-huh, the burning embers
MID:14:030:C	I vowed not to fight anymore
MID:14:031:C	If we survived the Great-War
MID:14:032:C	Uh-huh, uh-huh
MID:14:033:B	It turned into something bigger
MID:14:034:B	Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
MID:14:035:B	Your finger on my hairpin triggers
MID:14:036:B	Soldier down on that icy ground
MID:14:037:B	Looked up at me with honor and truth
MID:14:038:B	Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
MID:14:039:B	That was the night I nearly lost you
MID:14:040:B	I really thought I'd lost you
MID:14:041:V	We can plant a memory garden

MID:19:013:C	And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
MID:19:014:C	At nineteen
MID:19:015:C	And the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
MID:19:016:C	And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
MID:19:017:C	Memories feel like weapons
MID:19:018:C	And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
MID:19:019:V	If you never touched me, I would've
MID:19:020:V	Gone along with the righteous
MID:19:021:V	If I never blushed, then they could've
MID:19:022:V	Never whispered about this
MID:19:023:V	And if you never saved me from boredom
MID:19:024:V	I could've gone on as I was
MID:19:025:V	But, Lord, you made me feel important
MID:19:026:V	And then you tried to erase us
MID:19:027:C	Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
MID:19:028:C	Would've, could've, should've
MID:19:029:C	If I'd only played it safe
MID:19:030:C	I would've stayed on my knees

MID:19:048:V	Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
MID:19:049:V	Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
MID:19:050:V	Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
MID:19:051:C	And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil

MID:21:063:I	Shit my friends say to get me by
MID:21:064:I	'Cause it's you
MID:21:065:I	Catastrophic blues
MID:21:066:I	Movin' on was always easy for me to do
MID:21:067:I	It hits different (Yeah)
MID:21:068:I	It hits different 'cause it's you
MID:22:001:V	One night, a few moons ago
MID:22:002:V	I saw flecks of what could've been lights
MID:22:003:V	But it might just have been you
MID:22:004:V	Passing by unbeknownst to me
MID:22:005:V	Life is emotionally abusive
MID:22:006:V	And time can't stop me quite like you did
MID:22:007:V	And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
MID:22:008:V	I'm unglued, thanks to you
MID:22:009:C	And it's like snow at the beach
MID:22:010:C	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
MID:22:011:C	Flying in a dream
MID:22:012:C	Stars by the pocketful
MID:22:013:C	You wanting me
MID:22:014:C	Tonight feels impossible
MID:22:015:C	But it's comin' down
MID:22:016:C	No sound, it's all around
MID:22:017:C	Like snow on the beach
MID:22:018:C	Like snow on the beach
MID:22:019:C	Like snow on the beach
MID:22:020:C	Like snow, ah, ah
MID:22:021:V	This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
MID:22:022:V	I searched "Aurora-Borealis green"
MID:22:023:V	I've never seen someone lit from within
MID:22:024:V	Blurring out my periphery
MID:22:025:V	My smile is like I won a contest
MID:22:026:V	And to hide that would be so dishonest
MID:22:027:V	And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
MID:22:028:V	'Til you do, 'til it's true
MID:22:029:C	Now, it's like snow at the beach
MID:22:030:C	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
MID:22:031:C	Flying in a dream
MID:22:032:C	Stars by the pocketful
MID:22:033:C	You wanting me
MID:22:034:C	Tonight feels impossible
MID:22:035:C	But it's comin' down

MID:22:040:C	Like snow, ah, ah
MID:22:041:B	I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
MID:22:042:B	I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
MID:22:043:B	But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
MID:22:044:B	Now, I'm all for you like Janet
MID:22:045:B	Can this be a real thing? Can it?
MID:22:046:C	Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
MID:22:047:C	Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
MID:22:048:C	Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
MID:22:049:C	Stars by the pocketful
MID:22:050:C	You wanting me (You wanting me)
MID:22:051:C	Tonight feels impossible

MID:22:061:I	Like snow, like snow, uh-huh, yeah
TPD:01:001:V	I was supposed to be sent away
TPD:01:002:V	But they forgot to come and get me
TPD:01:003:V	I was a functioning alcoholic
TPD:01:004:V	'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
TPD:01:005:V	All of this to say I hope you're okay
TPD:01:006:V	But you're the reason
TPD:01:007:V	And no one here's to blame
TPD:01:008:V	But what about your quiet treason?
TPD:01:009:C	And for a fortnight there, we were forever
TPD:01:010:C	Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
TPD:01:011:C	Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
TPD:01:012:C	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
TPD:01:013:V	All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
TPD:01:014:V	I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
TPD:01:015:V	And I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:016:V	I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:017:V	I touched you for only a fortnight
TPD:01:018:V	I touched you, but I touched you
TPD:01:019:C	And for a fortnight there, we were forever
TPD:01:020:C	Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
TPD:01:021:C	Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
TPD:01:022:C	Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
TPD:01:023:C	And for a fortnight there, we were together
TPD:01:024:C	Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
TPD:01:025:C	Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
TPD:01:026:C	My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
TPD:01:027:B	I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:028:B	I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:029:B	I touched you for only a fortnight
TPD:01:030:B	I touched you, I touched you
TPD:01:031:B	I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:032:B	I love you, it's ruining my life
TPD:01:033:B	I touched you for only a fortnight
TPD:01:034:B	I touched you, I touched you
TPD:01:035:I	Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
TPD:01:036:I	'Nother fortnight lost in America
TPD:01:037:I	Move to Florida, buy the car you want
TPD:01:038:I	But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
TPD:01:039:I	Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
TPD:01:040:I	'Nother fortnight lost in America
TPD:01:041:I	Move to Florida, buy the car you want
TPD:01:042:I	But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you
TPD:02:001:V	You left your typewriter at my apartment
TPD:02:002:V	Straight from the tortured poets department
TPD:02:003:V	I think some things I never say
TPD:02:004:V	Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
TPD:02:005:V	But you're in self-sabotage mode
TPD:02:006:V	Throwing spikes down on the road
TPD:02:007:V	But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
TPD:02:008:V	Who else decodes you?
TPD:02:009:C	And who's gonna hold you like me?
TPD:02:010:C	And who's gonna know you, if not me?
TPD:02:011:C	I laughed in your face and said
TPD:02:012:C	"You're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
TPD:02:013:C	This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
TPD:02:014:C	And who's gonna hold you like me?
TPD:02:015:C	Nobody
TPD:02:016:C	No-fucking-body
TPD:02:017:C	Nobody
TPD:02:018:V	You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
TPD:02:019:V	We declared Charlie-Puth should be a bigger artist
TPD:02:020:V	I scratch your head, you fall asleep
TPD:02:021:V	Like a tattooed golden retriever
TPD:02:022:V	But you awaken with dread
TPD:02:023:V	Pounding nails in your head
TPD:02:024:V	But I've read this one where you come undone
TPD:02:025:V	I chose this cyclone with you
TPD:02:026:C	And who's gonna hold you like me?
TPD:02:027:C	(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
TPD:02:028:C	And who's gonna know you like me?
TPD:02:029:C	(Who's gonna know you?)
TPD:02:030:C	I laughed in your face and said
TPD:02:031:C	"You're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
TPD:02:032:C	This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we're modern idiots"
TPD:02:033:C	And who's gonna hold you like me?
TPD:02:034:C	(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
TPD:02:035:C	No-fucking-body
TPD:02:036:C	(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
TPD:02:037:C	Nobody
TPD:02:038:C	(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
TPD:02:039:C	Nobody
TPD:02:040:B	Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
TPD:02:041:B	But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
TPD:02:042:B	And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
TPD:02:043:B	Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
TPD:02:044:B	'Cause we're crazy
TPD:02:045:B	So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
TPD:02:046:B	At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
TPD:02:047:B	And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
TPD:02:048:B	And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
TPD:02:049:C	Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
TPD:02:050:C	Me
TPD:02:051:C	Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
TPD:02:052:C	Me
TPD:02:053:C	And you're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
TPD:02:054:C	This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we're two idiots
TPD:02:055:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:056:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:057:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:058:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:059:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:060:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:061:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:062:C	Who's gonna hold you?
TPD:02:063:C	Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?
TPD:02:064:I	You left your typewriter at my apartment
TPD:02:065:I	Straight from the tortured poets department
TPD:02:066:I	Who else decodes you?
TPD:03:001:V	Oh, here we go again
TPD:03:002:V	The voices in his head
TPD:03:003:V	Called the rain to end our days of wild
TPD:03:004:V	The sickest army doll
TPD:03:005:V	Purchased at the mall
TPD:03:006:V	Rivulets descend my plastic smile
TPD:03:007:C	But you should've seen him when he first got me
TPD:03:008:C	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
TPD:03:009:C	I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
TPD:03:010:C	'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
TPD:03:011:C	I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
TPD:03:012:C	My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
TPD:03:013:V	There was a litany of reasons why
TPD:03:014:V	We could've playеd for keeps this time
TPD:03:015:V	I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
TPD:03:016:V	Put me back on my shelf
TPD:03:017:V	But first, pull the string
TPD:03:018:V	And I'll tell you that he runs
TPD:03:019:V	Because he loves me (He loves me)
TPD:03:020:C	'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me
TPD:03:021:C	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
TPD:03:022:C	I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
TPD:03:023:C	'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
TPD:03:024:C	He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
TPD:03:025:C	My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
TPD:03:026:B	Once I fix me
TPD:03:027:B	He's gonna miss me
TPD:03:028:B	Once I fix me
TPD:03:029:B	He's gonna miss me
TPD:03:030:I	Just say when, I'd play again
TPD:03:031:I	He was my best friend down at the sandlot
TPD:03:032:I	I felt more when we played pretend
TPD:03:033:I	Than with all the Kens
TPD:03:034:I	'Cause he took me out of my box
TPD:03:035:I	Stole my tortured heart
TPD:03:036:I	Left all these broken parts
TPD:03:037:I	Told me I'm better off
TPD:03:038:I	But I'm not
TPD:03:039:I	I'm not, I'm not
TPD:04:001:V	Did you really beam me up
TPD:04:002:V	In a cloud of sparkling dust
TPD:04:003:V	Just to do experiments on?
TPD:04:004:V	Tell me I was the chosen one
TPD:04:005:V	Showed me that this world is bigger than us
TPD:04:006:V	Then sent me back where I came from
TPD:04:007:C	For a moment, I knew cosmic love
TPD:04:008:C	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
TPD:04:009:C	Everything comes out teenage petulance
TPD:04:010:C	"Fuck it if I can't have him"
TPD:04:011:C	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
TPD:04:012:C	Down bad, wakin' up in blood
TPD:04:013:C	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
TPD:04:014:C	Fuck it if I can't have us

TPD:04:016:C	Down bad
TPD:04:017:C	Fuck it if I can't have him
TPD:04:018:C	Down bad
TPD:04:019:C	Fuck it if I can't have him
TPD:04:020:V	Did you take all my old clothes
TPD:04:021:V	Just to leave me here, naked and alone
TPD:04:022:V	In a field in my same old town
TPD:04:023:V	That somehow seems so hollow now?
TPD:04:024:V	They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
TPD:04:025:V	The existence of you
TPD:04:026:C	For a moment, I was heavenstruck
TPD:04:027:C	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
TPD:04:028:C	Everything comes out teenage petulance
TPD:04:029:C	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)

TPD:04:032:C	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
TPD:04:033:C	Fuck it if I can't have us
TPD:04:034:C	I might just not get up, I might stay
TPD:04:035:C	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
TPD:04:036:C	Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
TPD:04:037:C	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
TPD:04:038:C	Fuck it if I can't have him
TPD:04:039:B	I loved your hostile takeovers
TPD:04:040:B	Encounters closer and closer
TPD:04:041:B	All your indecent exposures
TPD:04:042:B	How dare you say that it's—
TPD:04:043:B	I'll build you a fort on some planet
TPD:04:044:B	Where they can all understand it
TPD:04:045:B	How dare you think it's romantic
TPD:04:046:B	Leaving me safe and stranded
TPD:04:047:B	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
TPD:04:048:B	So fuck you if I can't have us
TPD:04:049:B	'Cause fuck it, I was in love
TPD:04:050:C	Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
TPD:04:051:C	Everything comes out teenage petulance
TPD:04:052:C	"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Can't have him)
TPD:04:053:C	"I might just die, it would make no difference"
TPD:04:054:C	Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
TPD:04:055:C	Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
TPD:04:056:C	Fuck it if I can't have us
TPD:04:057:C	I might just not get up, I might stay
TPD:04:058:C	Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
TPD:04:059:C	Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
TPD:04:060:C	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
TPD:04:061:C	Fuck it if I can't have him
TPD:04:062:I	Like I lost my twin

TPD:04:064:I	Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
TPD:04:065:I	Fuck it if I can't have him
TPD:05:001:I	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
TPD:05:002:I	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
TPD:05:003:I	So (So) long (Long), London (London)
TPD:05:004:V	I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
TPD:05:005:V	I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
TPD:05:006:V	Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
TPD:05:007:V	My spine split from carrying us up the hill
TPD:05:008:V	Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
TPD:05:009:V	I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
TPD:05:010:C	Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
TPD:05:011:C	Did you think I had in me?"
TPD:05:012:C	Oh, the tragedy
TPD:05:013:C	So long, London
TPD:05:014:C	You'll find someone
TPD:05:015:V	I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
TPD:05:016:V	I founded the club she's heard great things about
TPD:05:017:V	I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
TPD:05:018:V	I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
TPD:05:019:V	The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
TPD:05:020:V	And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
TPD:05:021:C	For so long, London
TPD:05:022:C	Stitches undone
TPD:05:023:C	Two graves, one gun
TPD:05:024:C	I'll find someone
TPD:05:025:B	And you say I abandoned the ship
TPD:05:026:B	But I was going down with it
TPD:05:027:B	My white-knuckle dying grip
TPD:05:028:B	Holding tight to your quiet resentment
TPD:05:029:B	And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
TPD:05:030:B	Every day of a love affair
TPD:05:031:B	Every breath feels like rarest air
TPD:05:032:B	When you're not sure if he wants to be there
TPD:05:033:C	So how much sad did you think I had
TPD:05:034:C	Did you think I had in me?
TPD:05:035:C	How much tragedy?
TPD:05:036:C	Just how low did you
TPD:05:037:C	Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
TPD:05:038:C	'Fore I'd have to go be free?
TPD:05:039:V	You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
TPD:05:040:V	I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
TPD:05:041:V	You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
TPD:05:042:V	And I'm just getting color back into my face
TPD:05:043:V	I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

TPD:06:001:V	I forget how the West was won
TPD:06:002:V	I forget if this was ever fun
TPD:06:003:V	I just learned these people only raise you
TPD:06:004:V	To cage you
TPD:06:005:V	Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
TPD:06:006:V	Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
TPD:06:007:V	I just learned these people try and save you
TPD:06:008:V	'Cause they hate you
TPD:06:009:C	Too high a horse for a simple girl
TPD:06:010:C	To rise above it
TPD:06:011:C	They slammed the door on my whole world
TPD:06:012:C	The one thing I wanted
TPD:06:013:C	Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
TPD:06:014:C	Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
TPD:06:015:C	I'm havin' his baby"
TPD:06:016:C	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
TPD:06:017:C	I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
TPD:06:018:C	No, I'm not coming to my senses
TPD:06:019:C	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
TPD:06:020:V	Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
TPD:06:021:V	Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
TPD:06:022:V	Growin' up precocious sometimes means
TPD:06:023:V	Not growin' up at all
TPD:06:024:V	He was chaos, he was revelry
TPD:06:025:V	Bedroom eyes like a remedy
TPD:06:026:V	Soon enough, the elders had convened
TPD:06:027:V	Down at the city hall
TPD:06:028:C	"Stay away from her"
TPD:06:029:C	The saboteurs protested too much
TPD:06:030:C	Lord knows the words we never heard
TPD:06:031:C	Just screeching tires and true love
TPD:06:032:C	And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
TPD:06:033:C	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
TPD:06:034:C	I'm havin' his baby"
TPD:06:035:C	No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
TPD:06:036:C	I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
TPD:06:037:C	No, I'm not coming to my senses
TPD:06:038:C	I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
TPD:06:039:C	I'll tell you something right now
TPD:06:040:C	I'd rather burn my whole life down
TPD:06:041:C	Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
TPD:06:042:C	I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
TPD:06:043:C	It's mine alone to disgrace
TPD:06:044:C	I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
TPD:06:045:B	god save the most judgmental creeps
TPD:06:046:B	Who say they want what's best for me
TPD:06:047:B	Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
TPD:06:048:B	Thinkin' it can change the beat
TPD:06:049:B	Of my heart when he touches me
TPD:06:050:B	And counteract the chemistry
TPD:06:051:B	And undo the destiny
TPD:06:052:B	You ain't gotta pray for me
TPD:06:053:B	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
TPD:06:054:B	If all you want is gray for me
TPD:06:055:B	Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
TPD:06:056:V	There's a lot of people in town that I
TPD:06:057:V	Bestow upon my fakest smiles
TPD:06:058:V	Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
TPD:06:059:V	We came back when the heat died down
TPD:06:060:V	Went to my parents and they came around
TPD:06:061:V	All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
TPD:06:062:C	Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
TPD:06:063:C	Even my daddy just loves him
TPD:06:064:C	I'm his lady
TPD:06:065:C	And, oh, my god, you should see your faces
TPD:06:066:C	Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
TPD:06:067:C	And, no, you can't come to the wedding
TPD:06:068:C	I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
TPD:06:069:C	I'll tell you something right now
TPD:06:070:C	You ain't gotta pray for me
TPD:06:071:C	Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
TPD:06:072:C	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
TPD:06:073:C	If all you want is gray for me
TPD:06:074:C	Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
TPD:06:075:I	Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
TPD:06:076:I	I'm having his baby"
TPD:06:077:I	No, I'm not
TPD:06:078:I	But you should see your faces
TPD:06:079:I	But, oh, my god, you should see your faces
TPD:06:080:I	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
TPD:06:081:I	(He was chaos, he was revelry)
TPD:07:001:I	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
TPD:07:002:I	Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
TPD:07:003:I	(Fresh out the slammer, oh)
TPD:07:004:V	Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
TPD:07:005:V	He don't understand me
TPD:07:006:V	Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
TPD:07:007:V	He was with her in dreams
TPD:07:008:C	Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
TPD:07:009:C	Handcuffed to the spell I was under
TPD:07:010:C	For just one hour of sunshine
TPD:07:011:C	Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
TPD:07:012:C	In the shade of how he was feeling
TPD:07:013:C	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
TPD:07:014:C	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
TPD:07:015:C	Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
TPD:07:016:C	(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)
TPD:07:017:V	Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
TPD:07:018:V	Toss the ashes off the ledge
TPD:07:019:V	As I said in my letters, now that I know better
TPD:07:020:V	I will never lose my baby again
TPD:07:021:C	My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
TPD:07:022:C	Watch me daily disappearing
TPD:07:023:C	For just one glimpse of his smile
TPD:07:024:C	All those nights, he kept me goin'
TPD:07:025:C	Swirled you into all of my poems
TPD:07:026:C	Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
TPD:07:027:C	Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
TPD:07:028:B	To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
TPD:07:029:B	To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
TPD:07:030:B	And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
TPD:07:031:B	Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
TPD:07:032:B	At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
TPD:07:033:B	Wearing imaginary rings
TPD:07:034:I	But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
TPD:08:001:V	You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
TPD:08:002:V	They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
TPD:08:003:V	And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
TPD:08:004:V	And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
TPD:08:005:C	Little did you know your home's really only
TPD:08:006:C	A town you're just a guest in
TPD:08:007:C	So you work your life away just to pay
TPD:08:008:C	For a time-share down in Destin
TPD:08:009:C	Florida
TPD:08:010:C	Is one hell of a drug
TPD:08:011:C	Florida
TPD:08:012:C	Can I use you up?
TPD:08:013:V	The hurricane with my name when it came
TPD:08:014:V	I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
TPD:08:015:V	Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
TPD:08:016:V	Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
TPD:08:017:V	Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
TPD:08:018:V	All my girls got their lace and their crimes
TPD:08:019:V	And your cheating husband disappeared, well
TPD:08:020:V	No one asks any questions here
TPD:08:021:V	So I did my best to lay to rest
TPD:08:022:V	All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
TPD:08:023:V	And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
TPD:08:024:V	Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
TPD:08:025:C	Little did you know your home's really only
TPD:08:026:C	The town you'll get arrested
TPD:08:027:C	So you pack your life away just to wait out
TPD:08:028:C	The shitstorm back in Texas
TPD:08:029:C	Florida
TPD:08:030:C	Is one hell of a drug
TPD:08:031:C	Florida
TPD:08:032:C	Can I use you up?
TPD:08:033:B	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
TPD:08:034:B	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
TPD:08:035:B	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
TPD:08:036:B	At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
TPD:08:037:B	I need to forget, so take me to Florida
TPD:08:038:B	I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
TPD:08:039:B	Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
TPD:08:040:B	What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
TPD:08:041:B	It's one hell of a drug
TPD:08:042:B	It's one hell of a drug
TPD:08:043:B	Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
TPD:08:044:B	So take me to Florida
TPD:08:045:C	Little did you know your home's really only
TPD:08:046:C	A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
TPD:08:047:C	So you work your life away just to pay
TPD:08:048:C	For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida)
TPD:08:049:C	Little did you know your home's really only
TPD:08:050:C	The town you'll get arrested (Florida)
TPD:08:051:C	So you pack your life away just to wait out
TPD:08:052:C	The shitstorm back in Texas
TPD:08:053:C	Florida
TPD:08:054:C	Is one hell of a drug
TPD:08:055:C	(Take me to) Florida
TPD:08:056:C	Can I use you up?
TPD:08:057:C	Florida
TPD:08:058:C	Is one hell of a drug
TPD:08:059:C	Florida
TPD:08:060:C	Go on, fuck me up
TPD:09:001:V	Drownin' in the Blue-Nile
TPD:09:002:V	He sent me "Downtown-Lights"
TPD:09:003:V	I hadn't heard it in a while
TPD:09:004:V	My boredom's bone-deep
TPD:09:005:V	This cage was once just fine
TPD:09:006:V	Am I allowed to cry?
TPD:09:007:V	I dream of crackin' locks
TPD:09:008:V	Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
TPD:09:009:V	Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
TPD:09:010:V	I'm seeing visions
TPD:09:011:V	Am I bad or mad or wise?
TPD:09:012:C	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
TPD:09:013:C	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
TPD:09:014:C	Oh, what a way to die
TPD:09:015:C	I keep recalling things we never did
TPD:09:016:C	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
TPD:09:017:C	Without ever touchin' his skin
TPD:09:018:C	How can I be guilty as sin?
TPD:09:019:V	I keep these longings lockеd
TPD:09:020:V	In lowercase, inside a vault
TPD:09:021:V	Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
TPD:09:022:V	Only your actions talk"
TPD:09:023:V	These fatal fantasies
TPD:09:024:V	Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
TPD:09:025:V	We've already done it in my head
TPD:09:026:V	If it's make-believe
TPD:09:027:V	Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
TPD:09:028:C	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
TPD:09:029:C	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
TPD:09:030:C	Oh, what a way to die
TPD:09:031:C	My bed sheets are ablaze
TPD:09:032:C	I've screamed his name
TPD:09:033:C	Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
TPD:09:034:C	Without ever touchin' his skin
TPD:09:035:C	How can I be guilty as sin?
TPD:09:036:B	What if I roll the stone away?
TPD:09:037:B	They're gonna crucify me anyway
TPD:09:038:B	What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
TPD:09:039:B	If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
TPD:09:040:B	They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
TPD:09:041:B	I choose you and me religiously
TPD:09:042:C	What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
TPD:09:043:C	One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
TPD:09:044:C	Oh, what a way to die
TPD:09:045:C	I keep recalling things we never did
TPD:09:046:C	Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
TPD:09:047:C	Without ever touchin' his skin
TPD:09:048:C	How can I be guilty as sin?
TPD:09:049:I	He sent me "Downtown-Lights"
TPD:09:050:I	I hadn't heard it in a while
TPD:09:051:I	Am I allowed to cry?
TPD:10:001:V	The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
TPD:10:002:V	But my bare hands paved their paths
TPD:10:003:V	You don't get to tell me about "sad"
TPD:10:004:C	If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
TPD:10:005:C	Nothing makes me feel more alive
TPD:10:006:C	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
TPD:10:007:C	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
TPD:10:008:C	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
TPD:10:009:C	You should be
TPD:10:010:V	The scandal was contained
TPD:10:011:V	The bullet had just grazed
TPD:10:012:V	At all costs, keep your good name
TPD:10:013:V	You don't get to tell me you feel bad
TPD:10:014:C	Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
TPD:10:015:C	Then we could all just laugh until I cry
TPD:10:016:C	So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
TPD:10:017:C	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
TPD:10:018:C	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
TPD:10:019:C	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
TPD:10:020:C	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
TPD:10:021:C	Who's afraid of little old me?
TPD:10:022:C	Well, you should be
TPD:10:023:C	(You should be) You should be
TPD:10:024:C	(You should be) You should be
TPD:10:025:C	You should be (You should be)
TPD:10:026:C	You should be (You should be)
TPD:10:027:C	You should be
TPD:10:028:B	So tell me everything is not about me
TPD:10:029:B	But what if it is?
TPD:10:030:B	Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
TPD:10:031:B	But what if they did?
TPD:10:032:B	I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
TPD:10:033:B	You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
TPD:10:034:B	So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
TPD:10:035:B	I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
TPD:10:036:B	That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
TPD:10:037:B	That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
TPD:10:038:B	Put narcotics into all of my songs
TPD:10:039:B	And that's why you're still singin' along
TPD:10:040:C	So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
TPD:10:041:C	Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
TPD:10:042:C	"Who's afraid of little old me?"
TPD:10:043:C	I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
TPD:10:044:C	"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
TPD:10:045:C	Who's afraid of little old me?
TPD:10:046:C	Well, you should be
TPD:10:047:C	(You should be) You should be
TPD:10:048:C	(You should be) You should be
TPD:10:049:C	'Cause you lured me (You should be)
TPD:10:050:C	And you hurt me (You should be)
TPD:10:051:C	And you taught me
TPD:10:052:I	You caged me and then you called me crazy
TPD:10:053:I	I am what I am 'cause you trained me
TPD:10:054:I	So who's afraid of me?
TPD:10:055:I	Who's afraid of little old me?
TPD:10:056:I	Who's afraid of little old me?
TPD:11:001:V	The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
TPD:11:002:V	Like a freight train through a small town
TPD:11:003:V	The jokes that he told across the bar
TPD:11:004:V	Were revolting and far too loud
TPD:11:005:C	They shake their heads sayin', "god, help her"
TPD:11:006:C	When I tell 'em he's my man
TPD:11:007:C	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
TPD:11:008:C	I can fix him, no, really, I can
TPD:11:009:C	And only I can
TPD:11:010:V	The dopamine races through his brain
TPD:11:011:V	On a six-lane Texas highway
TPD:11:012:V	His hand so calloused from his pistol
TPD:11:013:V	Softly traces hearts on my face
TPD:11:014:V	And I could see it from a mile away
TPD:11:015:V	A perfect case for my certain skill set
TPD:11:016:V	He had a halo of the highest gradе
TPD:11:017:V	He just hadn't met me yеt
TPD:11:018:C	They shake their heads sayin', "god, help her"
TPD:11:019:C	When I tell 'em he's my man
TPD:11:020:C	But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
TPD:11:021:C	I can fix him, no, really, I can
TPD:11:022:C	And only I can
TPD:11:023:B	Good boy, that's right, come close
TPD:11:024:B	I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
TPD:11:025:B	Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
TPD:11:026:B	No, really, I can
TPD:11:027:C	They shook their heads sayin', "god, help her"
TPD:11:028:C	When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
TPD:11:029:C	But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
TPD:11:030:C	I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
TPD:11:031:C	Woah, maybe I can't
TPD:12:001:V	Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
TPD:12:002:V	If we know the steps anyway?
TPD:12:003:V	We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
TPD:12:004:V	Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
TPD:12:005:V	I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
TPD:12:006:V	I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
TPD:12:007:V	I felt aglow like this
TPD:12:008:V	Never before and never since
TPD:12:009:C	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
TPD:12:010:C	You and I go from one kiss to getting married
TPD:12:011:C	Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
TPD:12:012:C	Never quite buried
TPD:12:013:C	In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
TPD:12:014:C	You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
TPD:12:015:C	You Holy-Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
TPD:12:016:C	You said I'm the love of your life
TPD:12:017:C	About a million times
TPD:12:018:V	Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
TPD:12:019:V	And told me I reformed you?
TPD:12:020:V	When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
TPD:12:021:V	Well, you took me to hell too
TPD:12:022:V	And all at once, the ink bleeds
TPD:12:023:V	A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
TPD:12:024:V	But I've felt a hole like this
TPD:12:025:V	Never before and ever since
TPD:12:026:C	If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
TPD:12:027:C	What we thought was for all time was momentary
TPD:12:028:C	Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
TPD:12:029:C	Never quite buried
TPD:12:030:C	You cinephile in black and white
TPD:12:031:C	All those plot twists and dynamite
TPD:12:032:C	Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
TPD:12:033:C	You said I'm the love of your life
TPD:12:034:B	You shit-talked me under the table
TPD:12:035:B	Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
TPD:12:036:B	I wish I could un-recall
TPD:12:037:B	How we almost had it all
TPD:12:038:B	Dancing phantoms on the terrace
TPD:12:039:B	Are they second-hand embarrassed
TPD:12:040:B	That I can't get out of bed
TPD:12:041:B	'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
TPD:12:042:B	It was legendary
TPD:12:043:B	It was momentary
TPD:12:044:B	It was unnecessary
TPD:12:045:B	Should've let it stay buried
TPD:12:046:C	Oh, what a valiant roar
TPD:12:047:C	What a bland goodbye
TPD:12:048:C	The coward claimed he was a lion
TPD:12:049:C	I'm combing through the braids of lies
TPD:12:050:C	"I'll never leave," "Never mind"
TPD:12:051:C	Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
TPD:12:052:C	Your arson's match, your somber eyes
TPD:12:053:C	And I'll still see it until I die
TPD:12:054:C	You're the loss of my life
TPD:13:001:V	I can read your mind
TPD:13:002:V	"She's having the time of her life"
TPD:13:003:V	There in her glittering prime
TPD:13:004:V	The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
TPD:13:005:V	I can show you lies
TPD:13:006:V	(One, two, three, four)
TPD:13:007:C	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
TPD:13:008:C	I can handle my shit
TPD:13:009:C	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
TPD:13:010:C	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
TPD:13:011:C	Even when you wanna die
TPD:13:012:C	He said he'd love me all his life
TPD:13:013:C	But that life was too short
TPD:13:014:C	Breaking down, I hit the floor
TPD:13:015:C	All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, "More"
TPD:13:016:C	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
TPD:13:017:C	I was hittin' my marks
TPD:13:018:C	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
TPD:13:019:C	(One, two, three, four)
TPD:13:020:C	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
TPD:13:021:C	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
TPD:13:022:C	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
TPD:13:023:C	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
TPD:13:024:V	I can hold my breath
TPD:13:025:V	I've been doin' it since he left
TPD:13:026:V	I keep finding his things in drawers
TPD:13:027:V	Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
TPD:13:028:V	I'm sure I can pass this test
TPD:13:029:V	(One, two, three, four)
TPD:13:030:C	'Cause I'm a real tough kid
TPD:13:031:C	I can handle my shit
TPD:13:032:C	They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
TPD:13:033:C	Lights, camera, bitch, smile
TPD:13:034:C	In stilettos for miles
TPD:13:035:C	He said he'd love me for all time
TPD:13:036:C	But that time was quite short
TPD:13:037:C	Breaking down, I hit the floor
TPD:13:038:C	All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
TPD:13:039:C	I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
TPD:13:040:C	I was hittin' my marks
TPD:13:041:C	'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
TPD:13:042:C	(One, two, three, four)
TPD:13:043:C	I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
TPD:13:044:C	I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
TPD:13:045:C	I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
TPD:13:046:C	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
TPD:13:047:I	You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
TPD:13:048:I	You know you're good
TPD:13:049:I	And I'm good
TPD:13:050:I	'Cause I'm miserable (ha ha)
TPD:13:051:I	And nobody even knows
TPD:13:052:I	Ah, try and come for my job
TPD:14:001:V	Was any of it true?
TPD:14:002:V	Gazing at me starry-eyed
TPD:14:003:V	In your Jehovah's-Witness suit
TPD:14:004:V	Who the fuck was that guy?
TPD:14:005:V	You tried to buy some pills
TPD:14:006:V	From a friend of friends of mine
TPD:14:007:V	They just ghosted you
TPD:14:008:V	Now you know what it feels like
TPD:14:009:C	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
TPD:14:010:C	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
TPD:14:011:C	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
TPD:14:012:C	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
TPD:14:013:V	You hung me on your wall
TPD:14:014:V	Stabbed me with your push pins
TPD:14:015:V	In public, showed me off
TPD:14:016:V	Then sank in stoned oblivion
TPD:14:017:V	'Cause once your queen had come
TPD:14:018:V	You'd treat her likе an also-ran
TPD:14:019:V	You didn't measure up
TPD:14:020:V	In any measurе of a man
TPD:14:021:C	And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
TPD:14:022:C	If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
TPD:14:023:C	And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
TPD:14:024:C	A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
TPD:14:025:B	Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
TPD:14:026:B	Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
TPD:14:027:B	Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
TPD:14:028:B	In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
TPD:14:029:B	And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, "Good riddance"
TPD:14:030:B	'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
TPD:14:031:B	I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
TPD:14:032:B	And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
TPD:14:033:B	You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
TPD:14:034:B	You crashed my party and your rental car
TPD:14:035:B	You said normal girls were boring
TPD:14:036:B	But you were gone by the morning
TPD:14:037:B	You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
TPD:14:038:I	And in plain sight you hid
TPD:14:039:I	But you are what you did
TPD:14:040:I	And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
TPD:14:041:I	The smallest man who ever lived
TPD:15:001:V	This happens once every few lifetimes
TPD:15:002:V	These chemicals hit me like white wine
TPD:15:003:V	What if I told you I'm back?
TPD:15:004:V	The hospital was a drag
TPD:15:005:V	Worst sleep that I ever had
TPD:15:006:V	I circled you on a map
TPD:15:007:V	I haven't come around in so long
TPD:15:008:V	But I'm coming back so strong
TPD:15:009:C	So when I touch down
TPD:15:010:C	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
TPD:15:011:C	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
TPD:15:012:C	Baby, I'm the one to beat
TPD:15:013:C	'Cause the sign on your heart
TPD:15:014:C	Said it's still reserved for me
TPD:15:015:C	Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
TPD:15:016:V	Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
TPD:15:017:V	That child's play back in school
TPD:15:018:V	Is forgiven under my rule
TPD:15:019:V	I haven't come around in so long
TPD:15:020:V	But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
TPD:15:021:C	So when I touch down
TPD:15:022:C	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
TPD:15:023:C	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
TPD:15:024:C	Baby, I'm the one to beat

TPD:15:027:C	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
TPD:15:028:C	These blokes warm the benches
TPD:15:029:C	We've been on a winning streak
TPD:15:030:C	He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
TPD:15:031:C	'Cause the sign on your heart
TPD:15:032:C	Said it's still reserved for me
TPD:15:033:C	Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
TPD:15:034:B	Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
TPD:15:035:B	Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
TPD:15:036:B	"There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
TPD:15:037:B	Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
TPD:15:038:C	Touchdown
TPD:15:039:C	Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
TPD:15:040:C	Ditch the clowns, get the crown
TPD:15:041:C	Baby, I'm the one to beat

TPD:15:051:I	This happens once every few lifetimes
TPD:15:052:I	These chemicals hit me like white wine
TPD:16:001:V	"You look like Clara-Bow
TPD:16:002:V	In this light, remarkable
TPD:16:003:V	All your life, did you know
TPD:16:004:V	You'd be picked like a rose?"
TPD:16:005:C	"I'm not trying to exaggerate
TPD:16:006:C	But I think I might die if it happened
TPD:16:007:C	Die if it happened to me
TPD:16:008:C	No one in my small town
TPD:16:009:C	Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"
TPD:16:010:C	"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
TPD:16:011:C	Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
TPD:16:012:C	Take the glory, give everything
TPD:16:013:C	Promise to be dazzling"
TPD:16:014:V	"You look like Stevie-Nicks
TPD:16:015:V	In '75, the hair and lips
TPD:16:016:V	Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
TPD:16:017:V	Half moonshine, a full еclipse"
TPD:16:018:C	"I'm not trying to exaggeratе

TPD:16:026:C	The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
TPD:16:027:C	Flesh and blood amongst war machines
TPD:16:028:C	You're the new god we're worshipping
TPD:16:029:C	Promise to be dazzling"
TPD:16:030:B	Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
TPD:16:031:B	Demanding more
TPD:16:032:B	Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
TPD:16:033:B	Do they let you know
TPD:16:034:B	It's hell on earth to be heavenly
TPD:16:035:B	Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
TPD:16:036:I	"You look like Taylor-Swift
TPD:16:037:I	In this light, we're lovin' it
TPD:16:038:I	You've got edge, she never did
TPD:16:039:I	The future's bright, dazzling"
TPD:17:001:V	I am someone who until recent events
TPD:17:002:V	You shared your secrets with
TPD:17:003:V	And your location, you forgot to turn it off
TPD:17:004:V	And so I watch as you walk
TPD:17:005:V	Into some bar called The-Black-Dog
TPD:17:006:V	And pierce new holes in my heart
TPD:17:007:V	You forgot to turn it off
TPD:17:008:V	And it hits me
TPD:17:009:C	I just don't understand
TPD:17:010:C	How you don't miss me in The-Black-Dog
TPD:17:011:C	When someone plays "The-Starting-Line"
TPD:17:012:C	And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
TPD:17:013:C	That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
TPD:17:014:C	Old habits die screaming
TPD:17:015:V	I move through the world with the heartbroken
TPD:17:016:V	My longings stay unspoken
TPD:17:017:V	And I may never open up thе way I did for you
TPD:17:018:V	And all of those best laid plans
TPD:17:019:V	You said I needed a bravе man
TPD:17:020:V	Then proceeded to play him
TPD:17:021:V	Until I believed it too
TPD:17:022:V	And it kills me
TPD:17:023:C	I just don't understand
TPD:17:024:C	How you don't miss me in the shower
TPD:17:025:C	And remember how my rain-soaked body
TPD:17:026:C	Was shakin', do you hate me?
TPD:17:027:C	Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
TPD:17:028:C	I pledged and I still mean it
TPD:17:029:C	Old habits die screaming
TPD:17:030:B	Six weeks of breathin' clean air
TPD:17:031:B	I still miss the smoke
TPD:17:032:B	Were you makin' fun of me
TPD:17:033:B	With some esoteric joke?
TPD:17:034:B	Now I wanna sell my house
TPD:17:035:B	And set fire to all my clothes
TPD:17:036:B	And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
TPD:17:037:B	Even if I die screaming
TPD:17:038:B	And I hope you hear it
TPD:17:039:C	And I hope it's shitty in The-Black-Dog
TPD:17:040:C	When someone plays "The-Starting-Line"
TPD:17:041:C	And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
TPD:17:042:C	That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
TPD:17:043:C	'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'
TPD:17:044:I	I still can't believe it
TPD:17:045:I	'Cause old habits die screaming
TPD:18:001:I	Yeah
TPD:18:002:V	Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
TPD:18:003:V	Did your research, you knew the price goin' in
TPD:18:004:V	And I'll tell you one thing, honey
TPD:18:005:V	I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
TPD:18:006:V	Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
TPD:18:007:V	Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)
TPD:18:008:C	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
TPD:18:009:C	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
TPD:18:010:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:011:C	Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
TPD:18:012:C	Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet
TPD:18:013:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:014:C	I, I hear thе whispers in your eyes
TPD:18:015:C	I'll make you wanna think twice
TPD:18:016:C	You'll find that you were never not mine
TPD:18:017:C	(You're mine)
TPD:18:018:V	Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
TPD:18:019:V	I'm an Aston-Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
TPD:18:020:V	Then ran and hid
TPD:18:021:V	And I'll tell you one thing, honey
TPD:18:022:V	I can take the upper hand and touch your body
TPD:18:023:V	Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
TPD:18:024:V	Or I might just love you 'til the end
TPD:18:025:C	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
TPD:18:026:C	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
TPD:18:027:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:028:C	Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
TPD:18:029:C	Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet
TPD:18:030:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:031:C	I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
TPD:18:032:C	I'll make you wanna think twice
TPD:18:033:C	You'll find that you were never not mine
TPD:18:034:C	(You're mine)
TPD:18:035:B	I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
TPD:18:036:B	Push the reset button, we're becomin' something new
TPD:18:037:B	Say you got somebody, I'll say I got someone too
TPD:18:038:B	Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leavin' here with you
TPD:18:039:B	Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)
TPD:18:040:B	We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
TPD:18:041:B	Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
TPD:18:042:B	Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way
TPD:18:043:C	Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
TPD:18:044:C	Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
TPD:18:045:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:046:C	Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
TPD:18:047:C	Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet
TPD:18:048:C	But I'm gonna get you back
TPD:18:049:C	I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
TPD:18:050:C	I'll make you wanna think twice
TPD:18:051:C	You'll find that you were never not mine
TPD:18:052:I	I'm gonna get you back
TPD:19:001:V	Wise men once said
TPD:19:002:V	"Wild winds are death to the candle"
TPD:19:003:V	A rose by any other name is a scandal
TPD:19:004:V	Cautions issued, he stood
TPD:19:005:V	Shooting the messengers
TPD:19:006:V	They tried to warn him about her
TPD:19:007:C	Cross your thoughtless heart
TPD:19:008:C	Only liquor anoints you
TPD:19:009:C	She's the albatross
TPD:19:010:C	She is here to destroy you
TPD:19:011:V	Wise men once said
TPD:19:012:V	"One bad seed kills the garden"
TPD:19:013:V	"One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen"
TPD:19:014:V	Locked me up in towers
TPD:19:015:V	But I'd visit in your dreams
TPD:19:016:V	And they tried to warn you about me
TPD:19:017:C	Cross your thoughtless heart
TPD:19:018:C	Only liquor anoints you
TPD:19:019:C	She's the albatross
TPD:19:020:C	She is here to destroy you
TPD:19:021:C	Devils that you know
TPD:19:022:C	Raise worse hell than a stranger
TPD:19:023:C	She's the death you chose
TPD:19:024:C	You're in terrible danger
TPD:19:025:B	And when that sky rains fire on you
TPD:19:026:B	And you're persona-non-grata
TPD:19:027:B	I'll tell you how I've been there too
TPD:19:028:B	And that none of it matters
TPD:19:029:V	Wise men once read fake news
TPD:19:030:V	And they believed it
TPD:19:031:V	Jackals raised their hackles
TPD:19:032:V	You couldn't conceive it
TPD:19:033:V	You were sleeping soundly
TPD:19:034:V	When they dragged you from your bed
TPD:19:035:V	And I tried to warn you about them
TPD:19:036:C	So I crossed my thoughtless heart
TPD:19:037:C	Spread my wings like a parachute
TPD:19:038:C	I'm the albatross
TPD:19:039:C	I swept in at the rescue
TPD:19:040:C	The devil that you know
TPD:19:041:C	Looks now more like an angel
TPD:19:042:C	I'm the life you chose
TPD:19:043:C	And all this terrible danger
TPD:19:044:C	(This terrible danger)
TPD:19:045:I	So cross your thoughtless heart
TPD:19:046:I	She's the albatross
TPD:19:047:I	She is here to destroy you
TPD:20:001:V	Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
TPD:20:002:V	Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
TPD:20:003:V	Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
TPD:20:004:V	And I just watched it happen
TPD:20:005:V	As the decade would play us for fools
TPD:20:006:V	And you saw my bones out with somebody new
TPD:20:007:V	Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
TPD:20:008:V	And you just watched it happen
TPD:20:009:C	If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
TPD:20:010:C	Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
TPD:20:011:C	If you wanna tear my world apart
TPD:20:012:C	Just say you've always wondered
TPD:20:013:V	You said some things that I can't unabsorb
TPD:20:014:V	You turned me into an idea of sorts
TPD:20:015:V	You needed me, but you needed drugs more
TPD:20:016:V	And I couldn't watch it happen
TPD:20:017:V	I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
TPD:20:018:V	Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
TPD:20:019:V	All to outrun my desertion of you
TPD:20:020:V	And you just watched it
TPD:20:021:C	If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
TPD:20:022:C	Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
TPD:20:023:C	If you wanna tear my world apart
TPD:20:024:C	Just say you've always wondered
TPD:20:025:B	If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
TPD:20:026:B	Down that passage in time back to the moment
TPD:20:027:B	I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
TPD:20:028:B	Too impaired by my youth to know what to do
TPD:20:029:V	So if I sell my apartment
TPD:20:030:V	And you have some kids with an internet starlet
TPD:20:031:V	Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?
TPD:20:032:V	Like it never happened
TPD:20:033:V	Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
TPD:20:034:V	Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
TPD:20:035:V	Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
TPD:20:036:V	It just didn't happen
TPD:20:037:C	So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
TPD:20:038:C	Say you loved me
TPD:20:039:C	And if you wanna tear my world apart
TPD:20:040:C	Say you'll always wonder
TPD:20:041:I	'Cause I wonder
TPD:20:042:I	Will I always
TPD:20:043:I	Will I always wonder?
TPD:21:001:I	(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
TPD:21:002:V	We hereby conduct this post-mortem
TPD:21:003:V	He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
TPD:21:004:V	Our maladies were such we could not cure them
TPD:21:005:V	And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign
TPD:21:006:C	Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
TPD:21:007:C	The empathetic hunger descends
TPD:21:008:C	We'll tell no one except all of our friends
TPD:21:009:C	We must know
TPD:21:010:C	How did it end?
TPD:21:011:C	(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
TPD:21:012:V	We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
TPD:21:013:V	We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
TPD:21:014:V	And fell victim to interlopers' glances
TPD:21:015:V	Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
TPD:21:016:V	Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
TPD:21:017:V	Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
TPD:21:018:V	Then feverishly calling their cousins
TPD:21:019:C	"Guess who we ran into at the shops?
TPD:21:020:C	Walking in circles like she was lost
TPD:21:021:C	Didn't you hear? They called it all off"
TPD:21:022:C	One gasp and then
TPD:21:023:C	"How did it end?"
TPD:21:024:B	Say it once again with feeling
TPD:21:025:B	How the death rattle breathing
TPD:21:026:B	Silenced as the soul was leaving
TPD:21:027:B	The deflation of our dreaming
TPD:21:028:B	Leaving me bereft and reeling
TPD:21:029:B	My beloved ghost and me
TPD:21:030:B	Sitting in a tree
TPD:21:031:B	D-Y-I-N-G
TPD:21:032:C	It's happenin' again
TPD:21:033:C	How did it end?
TPD:21:034:C	I can't pretend like I understand
TPD:21:035:C	How did it end?
TPD:21:036:C	Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
TPD:21:037:C	The empathetic hunger descends
TPD:21:038:C	We'll tell no one except all of our friends
TPD:21:039:C	But I still don't know
TPD:21:040:C	How did it end
TPD:22:001:I	I feel so high school every time I look at you
TPD:22:002:I	I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
TPD:22:003:C	And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
TPD:22:004:C	I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
TPD:22:005:C	Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
TPD:22:006:C	Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
TPD:22:007:C	I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
TPD:22:008:C	From smokin' your jokes all damn night
TPD:22:009:C	The brink of a wrinkle in time
TPD:22:010:C	Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
TPD:22:011:C	I'm watchin' American-Pie with you on a Saturday night
TPD:22:012:C	Your friends are around, so be quiet
TPD:22:013:C	I'm trying to stifle my sighs
TPD:22:014:C	'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
TPD:22:015:C	But look at you
TPD:22:016:C	Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
TPD:22:017:V	Are you gonna marry, kiss or kill me? (Kill me)
TPD:22:018:V	It's just a game, but really (Really)
TPD:22:019:V	I'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three)
TPD:22:020:V	Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
TPD:22:021:V	Then pull me to thе backseat (The backseat)
TPD:22:022:V	No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you
TPD:22:023:B	Truth, dare, spin bottles
TPD:22:024:B	You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
TPD:22:025:B	Brand-new, full throttle
TPD:22:026:B	Touch me while your bros play Grand-Theft-Auto
TPD:22:027:B	It's true, swear, scouts honor
TPD:22:028:B	You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
TPD:22:029:B	Brand-new, full throttle
TPD:22:030:B	You already know, babe
TPD:22:031:V	I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
TPD:22:032:V	Do that impression you did of your dad again
TPD:22:033:V	I'm hearing voices like a madman
TPD:22:034:C	And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
TPD:22:035:C	I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
TPD:22:036:C	Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
TPD:22:037:C	Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
TPD:22:038:C	I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
TPD:22:039:C	From smokin' your jokes all damn night
TPD:22:040:C	The brink of a wrinkle in time
TPD:22:041:C	Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
TPD:22:042:C	I'm watchin' American-Pie with you on a Saturday night
TPD:22:043:C	Your friends are around, so be quiet
TPD:22:044:C	I'm trying to stifle my sighs
TPD:22:045:C	'Cause I feel so high school (Feel so high school) every time I look at you
TPD:22:046:C	But look at you
TPD:22:047:I	Truth, dare, spin bottles
TPD:22:048:I	You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
TPD:22:049:I	Brand-new, full throttle
TPD:22:050:I	Touch me while your bros play Grand-Theft-Auto
TPD:22:051:I	It's true, swear, scouts honor
TPD:22:052:I	You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
TPD:22:053:I	Brand-new, full throttle
TPD:22:054:I	You already know, babe
TPD:22:055:I	You already know, babe
TPD:23:001:V	Quick, quick, tell me something awful
TPD:23:002:V	Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
TPD:23:003:V	Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
TPD:23:004:V	My eternal consolation prize
TPD:23:005:V	You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
TPD:23:006:V	Now I seem to be scared to go outside
TPD:23:007:V	If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
TPD:23:008:V	Now that I know what's what
TPD:23:009:C	I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
TPD:23:010:C	People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
TPD:23:011:C	I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
TPD:23:012:C	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
TPD:23:013:C	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
TPD:23:014:C	I hate it here
TPD:23:015:V	My friends used to play a game where
TPD:23:016:V	We would pick a decade
TPD:23:017:V	We wished we could live in instead of this
TPD:23:018:V	I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
TPD:23:019:V	And getting married off for the highest bid
TPD:23:020:V	Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
TPD:23:021:V	Seems like it was never even fun back then
TPD:23:022:V	Nostalgia is a mind's trick
TPD:23:023:V	If I'd been there, I'd hate it
TPD:23:024:V	It was freezing in the palace
TPD:23:025:C	I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind
TPD:23:026:C	When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived
TPD:23:027:C	I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die
TPD:23:028:C	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
TPD:23:029:C	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
TPD:23:030:C	I hate it here
TPD:23:031:B	I'm lonely, but I'm good
TPD:23:032:B	I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
TPD:23:033:B	I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
TPD:23:034:B	This place made me feel worthless
TPD:23:035:B	Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
TPD:23:036:B	And in my fantasies, I rise above it
TPD:23:037:B	And way up there, I actually love it
TPD:23:038:C	I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
TPD:23:039:C	People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
TPD:23:040:C	I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
TPD:23:041:C	No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
TPD:23:042:C	I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
TPD:23:043:C	I hate it here
TPD:23:044:I	Quick, quick, tell me something awful
TPD:23:045:I	Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
TPD:24:001:V	When I picture my hometown
TPD:24:002:V	There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
TPD:24:003:V	And a plaque underneath it
TPD:24:004:V	That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
TPD:24:005:C	And it was always the same searing pain
TPD:24:006:C	But I dreamed that one day I could say
TPD:24:007:C	All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
TPD:24:008:C	And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
TPD:24:009:C	Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
TPD:24:010:C	But I can't forget the way you made me heal
TPD:24:011:V	And it wasn't a fair fight
TPD:24:012:V	Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
TPD:24:013:V	And then she wrotе headlines
TPD:24:014:V	In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
TPD:24:015:C	And it was always the same searing pain
TPD:24:016:C	But I prayed that one day I could say
TPD:24:017:C	All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
TPD:24:018:C	And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
TPD:24:019:C	Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
TPD:24:020:C	But I can't forget the way you made me heal
TPD:24:021:C	Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
TPD:24:022:C	But she used to say she wished that you were dead
TPD:24:023:C	I pushed each boulder up the hill
TPD:24:024:C	Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head
TPD:24:025:B	I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
TPD:24:026:B	I built a legacy that you can't undo
TPD:24:027:B	But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
TPD:24:028:B	That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you
TPD:24:029:V	And maybe you've reframed it
TPD:24:030:V	And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
TPD:24:031:V	I don't think you've changed much
TPD:24:032:V	And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
TPD:24:033:V	And one day, your kid comes home singin'
TPD:24:034:V	A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause
TPD:24:035:C	All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
TPD:24:036:C	And our town, it looks so small from way up here
TPD:24:037:C	Screamed, "Thank you, Aimee" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
TPD:24:038:C	'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
TPD:24:039:C	Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
TPD:24:040:C	But she used to say she wished that you were dead
TPD:24:041:C	So I pushed each boulder up that hill
TPD:24:042:C	Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head
TPD:24:043:I	Thank you, Aimee
TPD:24:044:I	Thank you, Aimee
TPD:25:001:V	I had died the tiniest death
TPD:25:002:V	I spied the catch in your breath
TPD:25:003:V	Out, out, out, out, out, out
TPD:25:004:V	Northbound I got carried away
TPD:25:005:V	As you boarded your train
TPD:25:006:V	South, south, south, south, south, south
TPD:25:007:C	A feather taken by the wind blowing
TPD:25:008:C	I'm afflicted by the not knowing so
TPD:25:009:C	I look in people's windows
TPD:25:010:C	Transfixed by rose golden glows
TPD:25:011:C	They have their friends over to drink nice wine
TPD:25:012:C	I look in people's windows
TPD:25:013:C	In case you're at their table
TPD:25:014:C	What if your eyes looked up and met mine
TPD:25:015:C	One more time
TPD:25:016:V	You had stopped and tiltеd your head
TPD:25:017:V	I still ponder what it meant
TPD:25:018:V	Now, now, now, now, now, now
TPD:25:019:V	I triеd searching faces on streets
TPD:25:020:V	What are the chances you'd be
TPD:25:021:V	Downtown, downtown, downtown
TPD:25:022:C	Does it feel alright to not know me?
TPD:25:023:C	I'm addicted to the "if only"
TPD:25:024:C	So I look in people's windows
TPD:25:025:C	Like I'm some deranged weirdo
TPD:25:026:C	I attend Christmas parties from outside
TPD:25:027:C	I look in people's windows
TPD:25:028:C	In case you're at their table
TPD:25:029:C	What if your eyes looked up and met mine
TPD:25:030:C	One more time
TPD:26:001:V	Hand on the throttle
TPD:26:002:V	Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
TPD:26:003:V	Oh, but it's gone again
TPD:26:004:V	And it was written
TPD:26:005:V	I got cursed like Eve got bitten
TPD:26:006:V	Oh, was it punishment?
TPD:26:007:V	Pad around when I get home
TPD:26:008:V	I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
TPD:26:009:V	A greater woman wouldn't beg
TPD:26:010:V	But I looked to the sky and said
TPD:26:011:C	Please
TPD:26:012:C	I've been on my knees
TPD:26:013:C	Change the prophecy
TPD:26:014:C	Don't want money
TPD:26:015:C	Just someone who wants my company
TPD:26:016:C	Let it once be me
TPD:26:017:C	Who do I have to speak to
TPD:26:018:C	About if they can redo the prophecy?
TPD:26:019:V	Cards on thе table
TPD:26:020:V	Mine play out like fools in a fablе
TPD:26:021:V	Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
TPD:26:022:V	Slow is the quicksand
TPD:26:023:V	Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
TPD:26:024:V	Oh, still I dream of him
TPD:26:025:C	Please
TPD:26:026:C	I've been on my knees
TPD:26:027:C	Change the prophecy
TPD:26:028:C	Don't want money
TPD:26:029:C	Just someone who wants my company
TPD:26:030:C	Let it once be me
TPD:26:031:C	Who do I have to speak to
TPD:26:032:C	About if they can redo the prophecy?
TPD:26:033:B	And I sound like an infant
TPD:26:034:B	Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
TPD:26:035:B	A greater woman stays cool
TPD:26:036:B	But I howl like a wolf at the moon
TPD:26:037:B	And I look unstable
TPD:26:038:B	Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
TPD:26:039:B	A greater woman has faith
TPD:26:040:B	But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
TPD:26:041:B	I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
TPD:26:042:B	No sign of soulmates
TPD:26:043:B	I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
TPD:26:044:B	Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
TPD:26:045:B	Ooh
TPD:26:046:B	Ooh
TPD:26:047:B	Ooh
TPD:26:048:B	Ooh
TPD:26:049:C	Please
TPD:26:050:C	I've been on my knees
TPD:26:051:C	Change the prophecy
TPD:26:052:C	Don't want money
TPD:26:053:C	Just someone who wants my company
TPD:26:054:C	Let it once be me
TPD:26:055:C	Who do I have to speak to
TPD:26:056:C	About if they can redo the prophecy?
TPD:26:057:C	Who do I have to speak to
TPD:26:058:C	To change the prophecy?
TPD:26:059:I	Hand on the throttle
TPD:26:060:I	Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
TPD:26:061:I	Oh, but it's gone again
TPD:26:062:I	Pad around when I get home
TPD:26:063:I	I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
TPD:26:064:I	A greater woman wouldn't beg
TPD:26:065:I	But I looked to the sky and said (Please)
TPD:27:001:V	I was in my new house placing daydreams
TPD:27:002:V	Patching up the crack along the wall
TPD:27:003:V	I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
TPD:27:004:V	'Cause that's where I was when I got the call
TPD:27:005:C	When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
TPD:27:006:C	In the streets, there's a raging riot
TPD:27:007:C	When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
TPD:27:008:C	When the truth comes out, it's quiet
TPD:27:009:C	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
TPD:27:010:C	And tried to tell the town
TPD:27:011:C	So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
TPD:27:012:C	Do you believe me now?
TPD:27:013:V	I was in my tower weaving nightmares
TPD:27:014:V	Twisting all my smiles into snarls
TPD:27:015:V	They say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
TPD:27:016:V	What happens if it becomes who you are?
TPD:27:017:C	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
TPD:27:018:C	And tried to tell the town
TPD:27:019:C	So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
TPD:27:020:C	Do you believe me now?
TPD:27:021:B	They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
TPD:27:022:B	That I was onto somethin'
TPD:27:023:B	The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
TPD:27:024:B	They all said nothin'
TPD:27:025:B	Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
TPD:27:026:B	Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
TPD:27:027:B	You can mark my words that I said it first
TPD:27:028:B	In a mourning warning, no one heard
TPD:27:029:V	I patched up the crack along the wall
TPD:27:030:V	I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
TPD:27:031:V	'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all
TPD:27:032:C	So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
TPD:27:033:C	And tried to tell the town
TPD:27:034:C	So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
TPD:27:035:C	Do you believe me now?
TPD:27:036:B	Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
TPD:27:037:B	I was onto somethin'
TPD:27:038:B	Ah-ah-ah, ah
TPD:27:039:B	They all said nothin'
TPD:27:040:B	Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
TPD:27:041:B	Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
TPD:27:042:B	You can mark my words that I said it first
TPD:27:043:B	In a mourning warning, no one heard
TPD:27:044:B	No one heard, not a single word was heard
TPD:27:045:I	When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
TPD:27:046:I	In the streets, there's a raging riot
TPD:27:047:I	When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
TPD:27:048:I	When the truth comes out, it's quiet
TPD:27:049:I	It's so quiet
TPD:28:001:V	Forgive me, Peter
TPD:28:002:V	My lost fearless leader
TPD:28:003:V	In closets like cedar
TPD:28:004:V	Preserved from when we were just kids
TPD:28:005:V	Is it somethin' I did?
TPD:28:006:V	The goddess of timing
TPD:28:007:V	Once found us beguiling
TPD:28:008:V	She said she was trying
TPD:28:009:V	Peter, was she lying?
TPD:28:010:V	My ribs get the feeling she did
TPD:28:011:C	And I didn't wanna come down
TPD:28:012:C	I thought it was just goodbye for now
TPD:28:013:C	You said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:014:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:015:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:016:C	Thеn you were gonna come find mе
TPD:28:017:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:018:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:019:C	Words from the mouths of babes
TPD:28:020:C	Promises oceans deep
TPD:28:021:C	But never to keep
TPD:28:022:C	Oh, never to keep
TPD:28:023:V	Are you still a mind reader?
TPD:28:024:V	A natural scene stealer?
TPD:28:025:V	I've heard great things, Peter
TPD:28:026:V	But life was always easier on you
TPD:28:027:V	Than it was on me
TPD:28:028:V	And sometimes it gets me
TPD:28:029:V	When crossing your jet stream
TPD:28:030:V	We both did the best we could do
TPD:28:031:V	Underneath the same moon
TPD:28:032:V	In different galaxies
TPD:28:033:C	And I didn't wanna hang around
TPD:28:034:C	We said it was just goodbye for now
TPD:28:035:C	You said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:036:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:037:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:038:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:039:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:040:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:041:C	Words from the mouths of babes
TPD:28:042:C	Promises oceans deep
TPD:28:043:C	But never to keep
TPD:28:044:C	Never to keep
TPD:28:045:B	And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
TPD:28:046:B	As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
TPD:28:047:B	With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
TPD:28:048:B	'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
TPD:28:049:B	And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
TPD:28:050:B	And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
TPD:28:051:B	Lost to the "Lost-Boys" chapter of your life
TPD:28:052:B	Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
TPD:28:053:B	To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
TPD:28:054:B	When you were mine
TPD:28:055:B	But the woman who sits by the window
TPD:28:056:B	Has turned out the light
TPD:28:057:C	You said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:058:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:059:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:060:C	You said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:061:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:062:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:063:C	You said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:064:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:065:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:066:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:067:C	Said you were gonna grow up
TPD:28:068:C	Then you were gonna come find me
TPD:28:069:C	Words from the mouths of babes
TPD:28:070:C	Promises oceans deep
TPD:28:071:C	But never to keep
TPD:29:001:V	By all accounts, she almost drowned
TPD:29:002:V	When she was six in frigid water
TPD:29:003:V	And I can confirm she made
TPD:29:004:V	A curious child, ever reviled
TPD:29:005:V	By everyone except her own father
TPD:29:006:V	With a quite bewitching face
TPD:29:007:V	Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
TPD:29:008:V	Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
TPD:29:009:V	Then she runs like it's a race
TPD:29:010:V	Behind her back, her best mates laughed
TPD:29:011:V	And they nicknamed her "The-Bolter"
TPD:29:012:C	Started with a kiss
TPD:29:013:C	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
TPD:29:014:C	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
TPD:29:015:C	Out the drive one evening
TPD:29:016:C	Ended with the slam of a door
TPD:29:017:C	Then he'll call her a whore
TPD:29:018:C	Wish he wouldn't be sore
TPD:29:019:C	But as she was leaving
TPD:29:020:C	It felt like breathing
TPD:29:021:C	All her fuckin' lives
TPD:29:022:C	Flashed before her eyes
TPD:29:023:C	It feels like the time
TPD:29:024:C	She fell through the ice
TPD:29:025:C	Then came out alive
TPD:29:026:V	He was a cad, wanted her bad
TPD:29:027:V	Just like any good trophy hunter
TPD:29:028:V	And she liked the way it tastes
TPD:29:029:V	Taming a bear, making him care
TPD:29:030:V	Watching him jump then pulling him under
TPD:29:031:V	And at first blush, this is fate
TPD:29:032:V	When it's all roses, portrait poses
TPD:29:033:V	Central-Park-Lake in tiny rowboats
TPD:29:034:V	What a charming Saturday
TPD:29:035:V	That's when she sees the littlest leaks
TPD:29:036:V	Down in the floorboards
TPD:29:037:V	And she just knows she must bolt
TPD:29:038:C	Started with a kiss
TPD:29:039:C	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
TPD:29:040:C	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
TPD:29:041:C	Out the drive one evening
TPD:29:042:C	Ended with the slam of a door
TPD:29:043:C	Then he'll call her a whore
TPD:29:044:C	Wish he wouldn't be sore
TPD:29:045:C	But as she was leaving
TPD:29:046:C	It felt like breathing
TPD:29:047:C	All her fuckin' lives
TPD:29:048:C	Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
TPD:29:049:C	It feels like the time
TPD:29:050:C	She fell through the ice
TPD:29:051:C	Then came out alive
TPD:29:052:B	She's been many places with
TPD:29:053:B	Men of many faces
TPD:29:054:B	First, they're off to the races
TPD:29:055:B	And she's laughing, drawin' aces
TPD:29:056:B	But none of it is changin'
TPD:29:057:B	That the chariot is waitin'
TPD:29:058:B	Hearts are hers for the breakin'
TPD:29:059:B	There's escape in escaping
TPD:29:060:C	Started with a kiss
TPD:29:061:C	"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
TPD:29:062:C	But it always ends up with a town car speeding
TPD:29:063:C	Out the drive one evenin'
TPD:29:064:C	Ended with the slam of a door
TPD:29:065:C	But she's got the best stories
TPD:29:066:C	You can be sure
TPD:29:067:C	That as she was leaving
TPD:29:068:C	It felt like freedom
TPD:29:069:C	All her fuckin' lives
TPD:29:070:C	Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
TPD:29:071:C	It feels like the time
TPD:29:072:C	She fell through the ice
TPD:29:073:C	Then came out alive
TPD:30:001:V	Long may you reign
TPD:30:002:V	You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
TPD:30:003:V	Out window panes talking utter nonsense
TPD:30:004:V	You have no idea
TPD:30:005:C	Strings tied to levers
TPD:30:006:C	Slowed-down clocks tethered
TPD:30:007:C	All this showmanship
TPD:30:008:C	To keep it for you in sweetness
TPD:30:009:C	Way to go, tiger
TPD:30:010:C	Higher and higher
TPD:30:011:C	Wilder and lighter
TPD:30:012:C	For you
TPD:30:013:V	Long may you roar
TPD:30:014:V	At your dinosaurs
TPD:30:015:V	You're a just ruler
TPD:30:016:V	Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
TPD:30:017:V	And you have no idea
TPD:30:018:C	Buried down deep
TPD:30:019:C	And out of your reach
TPD:30:020:C	The secret we all vowed
TPD:30:021:C	To keep it from you in sweetness
TPD:30:022:C	Way to go, tiger
TPD:30:023:C	Higher and higher
TPD:30:024:C	Wilder and lighter
TPD:30:025:C	For you
TPD:30:026:B	You got the dragonflies above your bed
TPD:30:027:B	You have a favorite spot on the swing set
TPD:30:028:B	You have no room in your dreams for regrets
TPD:30:029:B	(You have no idea)
TPD:30:030:B	The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
TPD:30:031:B	You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
TPD:30:032:B	But now we'll curtail your curiosity
TPD:30:033:B	In sweetness
TPD:30:034:C	Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)
TPD:30:035:C	Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
TPD:30:036:C	Wilder and lighter
TPD:30:037:C	For you
TPD:31:001:V	Now and then she rereads the manuscript
TPD:31:002:V	Of the entire torrid affair
TPD:31:003:V	They compared their licenses
TPD:31:004:V	He said, "I'm not a donor but
TPD:31:005:V	I'd give you my heart if you needed it"
TPD:31:006:V	She rolled her eyes and said
TPD:31:007:V	"You're a professional"
TPD:31:008:V	He said, "No, just a good samaritan"
TPD:31:009:V	He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
TPD:31:010:V	Soon they'd be pushin' strollers
TPD:31:011:V	But soon it was over
TPD:31:012:V	In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
TPD:31:013:V	And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch-press
TPD:31:014:V	Afterwards she only atе kids' cereal
TPD:31:015:V	And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
TPD:31:016:V	Then she dated boys who were her own age
TPD:31:017:V	With dart boards on the backs of their doors
TPD:31:018:V	She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
TPD:31:019:V	Everything had been above board
TPD:31:020:V	She wasn't sure
TPD:31:021:B	And the years passed
TPD:31:022:B	Like scenes of a show
TPD:31:023:B	The professor said to write what you know
TPD:31:024:B	Lookin' backwards
TPD:31:025:B	Might be the only way to move forward
TPD:31:026:B	Then the actors
TPD:31:027:B	Were hitting their marks
TPD:31:028:B	And the slow dance
TPD:31:029:B	Was alight with the sparks
TPD:31:030:B	And the tears fell
TPD:31:031:B	In synchronicity with the score
TPD:31:032:B	And at last
TPD:31:033:B	She knew what the agony had been for
TPD:31:034:V	The only thing that's left is the manuscript
TPD:31:035:V	One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
TPD:31:036:V	Now and then I reread the manuscript
TPD:31:037:V	But the story isn't mine anymore
LSG:01:001:V	I heard you calling on the megaphone
LSG:01:002:V	You wanna see me all alone
LSG:01:003:V	As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
LSG:01:004:V	You light the match to watch it blow
LSG:01:005:C	And if you'd never come for me
LSG:01:006:C	I might've drowned in the melancholy
LSG:01:007:C	I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
LSG:01:008:C	Right before you lit my sky up
LSG:01:009:C	All that time
LSG:01:010:C	I sat alone in my tower
LSG:01:011:C	You were just honing your powers
LSG:01:012:C	Now I can see it all (See it all)
LSG:01:013:C	Late one night
LSG:01:014:C	You dug me out of my grave and
LSG:01:015:C	Saved my heart from the fate of
LSG:01:016:C	Ophelia (Ophеlia)
LSG:01:017:C	Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), thе sea (Sea), the sky
LSG:01:018:C	Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
LSG:01:019:C	Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine
LSG:01:020:C	It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
LSG:01:021:C	The fate of Ophelia
LSG:01:022:V	The eldest daughter of a nobleman
LSG:01:023:V	Ophelia lived in fantasy
LSG:01:024:V	But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
LSG:01:025:V	The venom stole her sanity
LSG:01:026:C	And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)
LSG:01:027:C	I might've lingered in purgatory
LSG:01:028:C	You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)
LSG:01:029:C	Pulling me into the fire
LSG:01:030:C	All that time
LSG:01:031:C	I sat alone in my tower
LSG:01:032:C	You were just honing your powers
LSG:01:033:C	Now I can see it all (See it all)
LSG:01:034:C	Late one night
LSG:01:035:C	You dug me out of my grave and
LSG:01:036:C	Saved my heart from the fate of
LSG:01:037:C	Ophelia (Ophelia)
LSG:01:038:C	Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
LSG:01:039:C	Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
LSG:01:040:C	Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine
LSG:01:041:C	It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
LSG:01:042:C	The fate of Ophelia
LSG:01:043:B	'Tis locked inside my memory
LSG:01:044:B	And only you possess the key
LSG:01:045:B	No longer drowning and deceived
LSG:01:046:B	All because you came for me
LSG:01:047:B	Locked inside my memory
LSG:01:048:B	And only you possess the key
LSG:01:049:B	No longer drowning and deceived
LSG:01:050:B	All because you came for me
LSG:01:051:C	All that time
LSG:01:052:C	I sat alone in my tower
LSG:01:053:C	You were just honing your powers
LSG:01:054:C	Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
LSG:01:055:C	Late one night
LSG:01:056:C	You dug me out of my grave and
LSG:01:057:C	Saved my heart from the fate of
LSG:01:058:C	Ophelia (Ophelia)
LSG:01:059:C	Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
LSG:01:060:C	Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands), your team, your vibes
LSG:01:061:C	Don't care where the hell you've been (You've been) 'cause now ('Cause now), you're mine
LSG:01:062:C	It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
LSG:01:063:C	The fate of Ophelia
LSG:01:064:I	You saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia
LSG:02:001:I	Elizabeth-Taylor
LSG:02:002:I	Do you think it's forever?
LSG:02:003:V	That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza-Athénée
LSG:02:004:V	Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
LSG:02:005:V	All the right guys promised they'd stay
LSG:02:006:V	Under bright lights, they withered away
LSG:02:007:V	But you bloom
LSG:02:008:V	Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)
LSG:02:009:C	And if your letters ever said, "Goodbye"
LSG:02:010:C	I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth-Taylor
LSG:02:011:C	Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
LSG:02:012:C	Been number one, but I never had two
LSG:02:013:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
LSG:02:014:C	Be my N.Y. whеn Hollywood hates me
LSG:02:015:C	You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
LSG:02:016:C	Been numbеr one, but I never had two
LSG:02:017:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have you
LSG:02:018:V	Hey-ey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
LSG:02:019:V	Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (Just kidding)
LSG:02:020:V	We hit the best booth at Musso-and-Frank's
LSG:02:021:V	They say I'm bad news, I just say, "Thanks"
LSG:02:022:V	And you
LSG:02:023:V	Look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why
LSG:02:024:C	And if you ever leave me high and dry
LSG:02:025:C	I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth-Taylor
LSG:02:026:C	Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
LSG:02:027:C	Been number one, but I never had two
LSG:02:028:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
LSG:02:029:C	Be my N.Y. when Hollywood hates me
LSG:02:030:C	You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
LSG:02:031:C	Been number one, but I never had two
LSG:02:032:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have (Uh) you
LSG:02:033:C	Elizabeth-Taylor (Oh)
LSG:02:034:C	Do you think it's forever? (Oh)
LSG:02:035:C	If I can't have you
LSG:02:036:B	(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
LSG:02:037:B	(Ah) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
LSG:02:038:B	(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
LSG:02:039:B	(Ah) Don't you ever end up anything but mine
LSG:02:040:C	I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth-Taylor
LSG:02:041:C	Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
LSG:02:042:C	Been number one, but I never had two
LSG:02:043:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)
LSG:02:044:C	Be my N.Y. when Hollywood hates me
LSG:02:045:C	You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
LSG:02:046:C	Been number one, but I never had two
LSG:02:047:C	And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)
LSG:02:048:I	All my white diamonds and lovers are forever (Elizabeth-Taylor)
LSG:02:049:I	(Do you think it's forever?) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
LSG:02:050:I	All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
LSG:02:051:I	Don't you ever end up anything but mine, oh
LSG:03:001:V	I had a bad habit
LSG:03:002:V	Of missing lovers past
LSG:03:003:V	My brother used to call it
LSG:03:004:V	"Eating out of the trash"
LSG:03:005:V	It's never gonna last
LSG:03:006:V	I thought my house was haunted
LSG:03:007:V	I used to live with ghosts
LSG:03:008:V	And all the perfect couples
LSG:03:009:V	Said, "When you know, you know"
LSG:03:010:V	And, "When you don't, you don't"
LSG:03:011:C	And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
LSG:03:012:C	Have seen it before, they'll see it again (Ha, ha)
LSG:03:013:C	Life is a song, it ends when it ends
LSG:03:014:C	I was wrong
LSG:03:015:C	But my mama told me, "It's alright
LSG:03:016:C	You were dancing through the lightning strikes
LSG:03:017:C	Sleepless in the onyx night
LSG:03:018:C	But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
LSG:03:019:C	Oh, my Lord
LSG:03:020:C	Never made no one like you bеfore
LSG:03:021:C	You had to make your own sunshine
LSG:03:022:C	But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
LSG:03:023:V	You couldn't understand it
LSG:03:024:V	Why you felt alone
LSG:03:025:V	You were in it for real
LSG:03:026:V	She was in her phone
LSG:03:027:V	And you were just a pose
LSG:03:028:V	And don't we try to love love? (Love love)
LSG:03:029:V	We give it all we got (Give it all we got)
LSG:03:030:V	You finally left the table (Uh, uh)
LSG:03:031:V	And what a simple thought
LSG:03:032:V	You're starving 'til you're not
LSG:03:033:C	And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
LSG:03:034:C	Have messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)
LSG:03:035:C	Life is a song, it ends when it ends
LSG:03:036:C	You move on
LSG:03:037:C	And that's when I told you, "It's alright
LSG:03:038:C	You were dancing through the lightning strikes
LSG:03:039:C	Sleepless in the onyx night
LSG:03:040:C	But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
LSG:03:041:C	Oh, my Lord
LSG:03:042:C	Never made no one like you before
LSG:03:043:C	You had to make your own sunshine
LSG:03:044:C	But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
LSG:03:045:B	This is just
LSG:03:046:B	A storm inside a teacup
LSG:03:047:B	But shelter here with me, my love
LSG:03:048:B	Thunder like a drum
LSG:03:049:B	This life will beat you up, up, up, up
LSG:03:050:B	This is just
LSG:03:051:B	A temporary speed-bump
LSG:03:052:B	But failure brings you freedom
LSG:03:053:B	And I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)
LSG:03:054:C	Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
LSG:03:055:C	You were dancing through the lightning strikes
LSG:03:056:C	Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night
LSG:03:057:C	But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
LSG:03:058:C	Oh, my Lord
LSG:03:059:C	Never made no one like you before (No)
LSG:03:060:C	You had to make your own sunshine
LSG:03:061:C	But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
LSG:04:001:V	When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
LSG:04:002:V	Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
LSG:04:003:V	The winding road leads to the chateau
LSG:04:004:V	"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
LSG:04:005:C	I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
LSG:04:006:C	I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
LSG:04:007:C	This love is pure profit, just step into my office
LSG:04:008:C	I dry your tears with my sleeve
LSG:04:009:C	Leave it with me, I protect the family
LSG:04:010:C	Leave it with me, I protect the family
LSG:04:011:V	I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
LSG:04:012:V	Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
LSG:04:013:V	I showed you all the tricks of the trade
LSG:04:014:V	All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
LSG:04:015:C	I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
LSG:04:016:C	I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
LSG:04:017:C	This love is pure profit, just step into my office
LSG:04:018:C	They'll know your name in the streets
LSG:04:019:C	Leave it with me, I'll protect the family
LSG:04:020:B	I saw a change in you (I saw a change, saw a change in you)
LSG:04:021:B	My dear boy
LSG:04:022:B	They don't make loyalty like they used to (Not like they used to)
LSG:04:023:B	Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
LSG:04:024:B	On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
LSG:04:025:B	That to fulfill your dreams
LSG:04:026:B	You had to get rid of me
LSG:04:027:B	I protect the family
LSG:04:028:C	I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
LSG:04:029:C	You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick's bigger
LSG:04:030:C	You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded
LSG:04:031:C	You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
LSG:04:032:C	Whose portrait's on the mantel? Who covered up your scandals?
LSG:04:033:C	Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
LSG:04:034:C	I was your father figure, you pulled the wrong trigger
LSG:04:035:C	This empire belongs to me
LSG:04:036:C	Leave it with me, I protect the family
LSG:04:037:C	Leave it with me, I protect the family
LSG:04:038:C	Leave it with me
LSG:04:039:I	"You know, you remind me of a younger me"
LSG:04:040:I	I saw potential
LSG:05:001:V	Everybody's so punk on the internet
LSG:05:002:V	Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
LSG:05:003:V	Every joke's just trolling and memes
LSG:05:004:V	Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
LSG:05:005:V	Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
LSG:05:006:V	Every single hot take is cold as ice
LSG:05:007:V	When you found me, I said I was busy
LSG:05:008:V	That was a lie
LSG:05:009:C	I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
LSG:05:010:C	I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
LSG:05:011:C	But I'm not a bad bitch
LSG:05:012:C	And this isn't savage
LSG:05:013:C	But I'm never gonna let you down
LSG:05:014:C	I'm never gonna leave you out
LSG:05:015:C	So many traitors
LSG:05:016:C	Smooth operators
LSG:05:017:C	But I'm never gonna break that vow
LSG:05:018:C	I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
LSG:05:019:V	You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
LSG:05:020:V	On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
LSG:05:021:V	I must've been about eight or nine
LSG:05:022:V	That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
LSG:05:023:V	Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
LSG:05:024:V	When your first crush crushes something kind
LSG:05:025:V	When I said I don't believe in marriage
LSG:05:026:V	That was a lie
LSG:05:027:C	Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter
LSG:05:028:C	So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire
LSG:05:029:C	But I'm not a bad bitch
LSG:05:030:C	And this isn't savage
LSG:05:031:C	But I'm never gonna let you down
LSG:05:032:C	I'm never gonna leave you out
LSG:05:033:C	So many traitors
LSG:05:034:C	Smooth operators
LSG:05:035:C	But I'm never gonna break that vow
LSG:05:036:C	I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now
LSG:05:037:B	We lie back
LSG:05:038:B	A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
LSG:05:039:B	Ferris-wheels, kisses, and lilacs
LSG:05:040:B	And things I said were dumb
LSG:05:041:B	'Cause I thought that I'd never find that
LSG:05:042:B	Beautiful, beautiful life that
LSG:05:043:B	Shimmers that innocent light back
LSG:05:044:B	Like when we were young
LSG:05:045:C	Every youngest child felt
LSG:05:046:C	They were raised up in the wild
LSG:05:047:C	But now you're home
LSG:05:048:C	'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
LSG:05:049:C	And this isn't savage
LSG:05:050:C	And I'm never gonna let you down
LSG:05:051:C	I'm never gonna leave you out
LSG:05:052:C	So many traitors
LSG:05:053:C	Smooth operators
LSG:05:054:C	But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow)
LSG:05:055:C	I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now
LSG:05:056:I	Never gonna break that vow (Oh)
LSG:05:057:I	I'm never gonna leave you now, now
LSG:05:058:I	I'm never gonna leave you now
LSG:06:001:V	Glistening grass from September rain
LSG:06:002:V	Gray overpass full of neon names
LSG:06:003:V	You drive (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:004:V	Eighty-five (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:005:V	Gallatin-Road and the Lakeside-Beach
LSG:06:006:V	Watching the game from your brother's Jeep
LSG:06:007:V	Your smile (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:008:V	Miles wide
LSG:06:009:C	And it was not an invitation
LSG:06:010:C	Should've kissed you anyway
LSG:06:011:C	Should've kissed you anyway
LSG:06:012:C	And it was not convenient, no
LSG:06:013:C	But your girlfriend was away
LSG:06:014:C	Should've kissed you anyway, hey
LSG:06:015:V	Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
LSG:06:016:V	Disco ball makes everything look cheap
LSG:06:017:V	Have fun (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:018:V	It's prom (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:019:V	Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist
LSG:06:020:V	Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
LSG:06:021:V	And see (Mm, mm)
LSG:06:022:V	You looking at mе
LSG:06:023:C	And it was not an invitation
LSG:06:024:C	But as the 50-Cent song played (Song playеd)
LSG:06:025:C	Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
LSG:06:026:C	And it was not (And it was not) convenient (Convenient), no
LSG:06:027:C	Would've been the best mistake
LSG:06:028:C	Should've kissed you anyway, hey
LSG:06:029:B	Don't make it awkward in second period
LSG:06:030:B	Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
LSG:06:031:B	Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should
LSG:06:032:B	Don't make it awkward in second period
LSG:06:033:B	Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
LSG:06:034:B	Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should
LSG:06:035:V	When I left school, I lost track of you
LSG:06:036:V	Abigail called me with the bad news
LSG:06:037:V	Goodbye
LSG:06:038:V	And we'll never know why
LSG:06:039:C	It was not an invitation
LSG:06:040:C	But I flew home anyway
LSG:06:041:C	With so much left to say
LSG:06:042:C	It was not convenient, no
LSG:06:043:C	But I whispered at the grave
LSG:06:044:C	"Should've kissed you anyway," ooh
LSG:06:045:C	And it was not (It was not) an invitation (Invitation)
LSG:06:046:C	Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
LSG:06:047:C	Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway), anyway
LSG:06:048:C	And it was not—
LSG:06:049:C	My advice is to always ruin the friendship
LSG:06:050:C	Better that than regret it for all time
LSG:06:051:C	Should've kissed you anyway
LSG:06:052:C	And my advice is to always answer the question
LSG:06:053:C	Better that than to ask it all your life
LSG:06:054:C	Should've kissed you anyway
LSG:06:055:I	Should've kissed you anyway
LSG:07:001:V	I heard you call me "Boring Barbie" when the coke's got you brave
LSG:07:002:V	High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me
LSG:07:003:V	Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face
LSG:07:004:V	Some people might be offended
LSG:07:005:C	But it's actually sweet
LSG:07:006:C	All the time you've spent on me
LSG:07:007:C	It's honestly wild
LSG:07:008:C	All the effort you've put in
LSG:07:009:C	It's actually romantic
LSG:07:010:C	I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
LSG:07:011:C	No man has ever loved me like you do
LSG:07:012:V	Hadn't thought of you in a long time
LSG:07:013:V	But you keep sending me funny valentines
LSG:07:014:V	And I know you think it comes off vicious
LSG:07:015:V	But it's precious, adorable
LSG:07:016:V	Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse
LSG:07:017:V	That's how much it hurts
LSG:07:018:V	How many times has your boyfriend said
LSG:07:019:V	"Why are we always talking 'bout her?"
LSG:07:020:C	It's actually sweet
LSG:07:021:C	All the time you've spent on me
LSG:07:022:C	It's honestly wild
LSG:07:023:C	All the effort you've put in
LSG:07:024:C	It's actually romantic
LSG:07:025:C	I really gotta hand it to you, ooh

LSG:07:027:B	You think I'm tacky, baby
LSG:07:028:B	Stop talking dirty to me
LSG:07:029:B	It sounded nasty, but it
LSG:07:030:B	Feels like you're flirting with me
LSG:07:031:B	I mind my business, god's my witness that I don't provoke it
LSG:07:032:B	It's kind of making me wet (Oh)
LSG:07:033:C	'Cause it's actually sweet
LSG:07:034:C	All the time you've spent on me (Ah)
LSG:07:035:C	It's honestly lovely
LSG:07:036:C	All the effort you've put in (Ah)
LSG:07:037:C	It's actually romantic
LSG:07:038:C	Really gotta hand it to you, to you
LSG:07:039:C	No man has ever loved me like you do
LSG:07:040:I	It's actually romantic (You've just given me so much attention) (La-la-la-la)
LSG:07:041:I	It's actually romantic
LSG:07:042:I	(It's so) Romantic

LSG:09:004:V	Penny's unlucky, I took him back
LSG:09:005:V	And then stepped on a crack
LSG:09:006:V	And the black cat laughed
LSG:09:007:C	And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
LSG:09:008:C	Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine (Ah)
LSG:09:009:C	Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
LSG:09:010:C	A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
LSG:09:011:C	(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star

LSG:09:023:C	Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
LSG:09:024:C	New-Heights (New-Heights) of manhood (Manhood), I ain't gotta knock on wood
LSG:09:025:C	(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
LSG:09:026:C	Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
LSG:09:027:C	(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
LSG:09:028:C	All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
LSG:09:029:C	Forgive me, it sounds cocky
LSG:09:030:C	He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
LSG:09:031:C	Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
LSG:09:032:C	His love was the key that opened my thighs
LSG:09:033:C	Forgive me, it sounds cocky
LSG:09:034:C	He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
LSG:09:035:C	Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
LSG:09:036:C	His love was the key that opened my thighs
LSG:10:001:V	You thought that it would be okay, at first
LSG:10:002:V	The situation could be saved, of course
LSG:10:003:V	But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
LSG:10:004:V	Beware the wrath of masked crusaders
LSG:10:005:C	Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
LSG:10:006:C	Did they catch you having far too much fun?
LSG:10:007:C	Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
LSG:10:008:C	Something wicked this way comes
LSG:10:009:C	Good thing I like my friends cancelled
LSG:10:010:C	I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
LSG:10:011:C	Like my whiskey-sour, and poison thorny flowers
LSG:10:012:C	Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
LSG:10:013:C	At least you know exactly who your friends are
LSG:10:014:C	They're the ones with matching scars
LSG:10:015:V	It's easy to love you when you're popular
LSG:10:016:V	The optics click, everyone prospers
LSG:10:017:V	But one single drop, you're off the roster
LSG:10:018:V	"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"
LSG:10:019:C	Did you make a joke only a man could?
LSG:10:020:C	Were you just too smug for your own good?
LSG:10:021:C	Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?
LSG:10:022:C	Baby, that all ends tonight
LSG:10:023:C	Good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)
LSG:10:024:C	I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal (Yeah)
LSG:10:025:C	Like my whiskey-sour, and poison thorny flowers
LSG:10:026:C	(Honey) Welcome to my underworld, it'll break your heart
LSG:10:027:C	At least you know exactly who your friends are
LSG:10:028:C	They're the ones with matching scars
LSG:10:029:B	They stood by me before my exoneration
LSG:10:030:B	They believed I was innocent
LSG:10:031:B	So I'm not here for judgment, no
LSG:10:032:V	But if you can't be good, then just be better at it
LSG:10:033:V	Everyone's got bodies in the attic
LSG:10:034:V	Or took somebody's man, we'll take you by the hand
LSG:10:035:V	And soon, you'll learn the art of never getting caught
LSG:10:036:C	It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled
LSG:10:037:C	(You know that) I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
LSG:10:038:C	I like my whiskey-sour, and poison thorny flowers (Ooh)
LSG:10:039:C	Yeah, it's a good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)
LSG:10:040:C	I salute you if you're much too much to handle
LSG:10:041:C	Like my whiskey-sour (I like it), and poison thorny flowers (I love it)
LSG:10:042:C	Can't you see my infamy loves company?
LSG:10:043:C	Now they've broken you like they've broken me
LSG:10:044:C	But a shattered glass is a lot more sharp
LSG:10:045:C	And now you know exactly who your friends are (You know who we are)
LSG:10:046:C	We're the ones with matching scars
LSG:11:001:I	You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
LSG:11:002:I	Mm, mm
LSG:11:003:C	When anyone called me "sweetheart"
LSG:11:004:C	It was passive-aggressive at the bar
LSG:11:005:C	And the bitch was telling me to back off
LSG:11:006:C	'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
LSG:11:007:C	If anyone called me "honey"
LSG:11:008:C	It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
LSG:11:009:C	They were saying that skirt don't fit me
LSG:11:010:C	And I cried the whole way home
LSG:11:011:C	But you touched my face
LSG:11:012:C	Redefined all of those blues when you say "honey"
LSG:11:013:V	Summertime spritz, pink skies
LSG:11:014:V	You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
LSG:11:015:V	Wintergreen kiss, all mine
LSG:11:016:V	You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
LSG:11:017:V	Honey, I'm home, we could play house
LSG:11:018:V	We can bed down, pick me up
LSG:11:019:V	Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
LSG:11:020:V	You could be my forever-night-stand, honey
LSG:11:021:C	When anyone called me "sweetheart"
LSG:11:022:C	It was passive-aggressive at the bar
LSG:11:023:C	And the bitch was telling me to back off
LSG:11:024:C	'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
LSG:11:025:C	If anyone called me "honey"
LSG:11:026:C	It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
LSG:11:027:C	They were saying that skirt don't fit me
LSG:11:028:C	And I cried the whole way home
LSG:11:029:C	But you touched my face
LSG:11:030:C	Redefined all of those blues when you say—
LSG:11:031:V	You can call me "honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
LSG:11:032:V	I'm the one you want
LSG:11:033:V	You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
LSG:11:034:V	Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors
LSG:11:035:V	Take it to the floor, give me more
LSG:11:036:V	Buy the paint in the color of your eyes (Of your eyes)
LSG:11:037:V	And graffiti my whole damn life, honey
LSG:11:038:C	When anyone called me late night
LSG:11:039:C	He was screwing around with my mind
LSG:11:040:C	Asking, "What are you wearing?", too high
LSG:11:041:C	To remember in the morning
LSG:11:042:C	And when anyone called me "lovely"
LSG:11:043:C	They were finding ways not to praise me
LSG:11:044:C	But you say it like you're in awe of me
LSG:11:045:C	And you stay until the morning
LSG:11:046:C	Honey
LSG:11:047:C	When anyone called me "sweetheart"
LSG:11:048:C	It was passive-aggressive at the bar
LSG:11:049:C	And the bitch was telling me to back off
LSG:11:050:C	'Cause her man had looked at me wrong (He looked at me wrong)
LSG:11:051:C	If anyone called me "honey" (Ooh)
LSG:11:052:C	It was standing in the bathroom (Yeah), white teeth
LSG:11:053:C	They were saying that skirt don't fit me
LSG:11:054:C	And I cried the whole way home (Cried the whole way home)
LSG:11:055:I	But you can call me "honey" if you want
LSG:12:001:V	Her name was Kitty
LSG:12:002:V	Made her money being pretty and witty
LSG:12:003:V	They gave her the keys to this city
LSG:12:004:V	Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
LSG:12:005:V	I bought a ticket
LSG:12:006:V	She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
LSG:12:007:V	Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
LSG:12:008:V	Looking back, I guess it was kismet
LSG:12:009:C	I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
LSG:12:010:C	Barking her name, then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
LSG:12:011:C	I said, "You're living my drеam"
LSG:12:012:C	Then she said to me
LSG:12:013:C	"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
LSG:12:014:C	You're sweeter than a peach
LSG:12:015:C	But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:016:C	And you're never, ever gonna
LSG:12:017:C	Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
LSG:12:018:C	You're softer than a kitten, so
LSG:12:019:C	You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:020:C	And you're never gonna wanna"
LSG:12:021:V	She was a menace
LSG:12:022:V	The baby of the family in Lenox
LSG:12:023:V	Her father whored around like all men did
LSG:12:024:V	Her mother took pills and played tennis
LSG:12:025:C	So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
LSG:12:026:C	She said, "I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine"
LSG:12:027:C	But that's not what showgirls get
LSG:12:028:C	They leave us for dead
LSG:12:029:C	Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
LSG:12:030:C	You're sweeter than a peach
LSG:12:031:C	But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:032:C	And you're never, ever gonna
LSG:12:033:C	Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
LSG:12:034:C	You're softer than a kitten, so
LSG:12:035:C	You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:036:C	And you're never gonna wanna
LSG:12:037:B	I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck
LSG:12:038:B	I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect
LSG:12:039:B	Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
LSG:12:040:B	They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away
LSG:12:041:B	And all the headshots on the walls
LSG:12:042:B	Of the dance hall are of the bitches
LSG:12:043:B	Who wish I'd hurry up and die
LSG:12:044:B	But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
LSG:12:045:B	I couldn't if I tried
LSG:12:046:B	So I say
LSG:12:047:C	"Thank you for the lovely bouquet
LSG:12:048:C	I'm married to the hustle
LSG:12:049:C	And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:050:C	And I'll never know another
LSG:12:051:C	Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)
LSG:12:052:C	Sequins are forever
LSG:12:053:C	And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
LSG:12:054:C	Wouldn't have it any other way" (Wouldn't have it any other way)
LSG:12:055:C	(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
LSG:12:056:C	Oh, wouldn't have it any other way
LSG:12:057:C	(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
LSG:12:058:C	Hey, Kitty
LSG:12:059:C	(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
LSG:12:060:C	Now I make my money being pretty and witty
LSG:12:061:C	Thank you for the lovely bouquet
LSG:12:062:I	Thank you for an unforgettable night
LSG:12:063:I	We will see you next time
LSG:12:064:I	Give it up for the band
LSG:12:065:I	And the dancers
LSG:12:066:I	And of course, Sabrina
LSG:12:067:I	I love you, Taylor
LSG:12:068:I	That's our show
LSG:12:069:I	We love you so much
LSG:12:070:I	Goodnight
OTH:01:001:V	Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
OTH:01:002:V	Lost I was born, lonesome I came
OTH:01:003:V	Lonesome I'll always stay
OTH:01:004:V	Carolina knows why, for years, I roam
OTH:01:005:V	Free as these birds, light as whispers
OTH:01:006:V	Carolina knows
OTH:01:007:C	And you didn't see me here
OTH:01:008:C	No, they never did see me here
OTH:01:009:C	And she's in my dreams
OTH:01:010:C	Into the mist, into the clouds
OTH:01:011:C	Don't leave
OTH:01:012:C	I make a fist, I'll make it count
OTH:01:013:C	And there are places I will never, ever go
OTH:01:014:C	And things that only Carolina will ever know
OTH:01:015:V	Carolina stains on the dress she left
OTH:01:016:V	Indelible scars, pivotal marks
OTH:01:017:V	Blue as the life she fled
OTH:01:018:V	Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
OTH:01:019:V	Hide me like robes down the back road
OTH:01:020:V	Muddy these webs we weave
OTH:01:021:C	And you didn't see me here
OTH:01:022:C	Oh, they never did see me
OTH:01:023:C	And she's in my dreams
OTH:01:024:C	Into the mist, into the clouds
OTH:01:025:C	Don't leave
OTH:01:026:C	I make a fist, I'll make it count
OTH:01:027:C	And there are places I will never, ever go
OTH:01:028:C	And things that only Carolina will ever know
OTH:01:029:B	And you didn't see me here
OTH:01:030:B	They never did see me here
OTH:01:031:B	No, you didn't see me here
OTH:01:032:B	They never saw me
OTH:01:033:I	Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
OTH:01:034:I	That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
OTH:01:035:I	But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts
OTH:01:036:I	It's between me, the sand, and the sea
OTH:01:037:I	Carolina knows
OTH:02:001:V	It keeps me awake, the look on your face
OTH:02:002:V	The moment you heard the news
OTH:02:003:V	You're screaming inside and frozen in time
OTH:02:004:V	You did all that you could do
OTH:02:005:V	The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
OTH:02:006:V	The wrong ones think they're right
OTH:02:007:V	You were outnumbered this time
OTH:02:008:C	But only the young, only the young
OTH:02:009:C	Only the young, only the young
OTH:02:010:C	Can run
OTH:02:011:C	Can run
OTH:02:012:C	So run, and run, and run
OTH:02:013:V	So every day now
OTH:02:014:V	You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
OTH:02:015:V	You go to class, scared
OTH:02:016:V	Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
OTH:02:017:V	And the big bad man and his big bad clan
OTH:02:018:V	Their hands are stained with red
OTH:02:019:V	Oh, how quickly they forget
OTH:02:020:C	They aren't gonna help us
OTH:02:021:C	Too busy helping themselves
OTH:02:022:C	They aren't gonna change this
OTH:02:023:C	We gotta do it ourselves
OTH:02:024:C	They think that it's over
OTH:02:025:C	But it's just begun
OTH:02:026:C	Only one thing can save us
OTH:02:027:C	Only the young (Only the young)
OTH:02:028:C	Only the young (Only the young)
OTH:02:029:C	Only the young (Only the young)
OTH:02:030:C	Only the young

OTH:02:032:C	Only the young (Only the young)
OTH:02:033:C	Only the young (Only the young)
OTH:02:034:C	Only the young
OTH:02:035:C	Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
OTH:02:036:C	Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
OTH:02:037:C	Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
OTH:02:038:C	Only the young
OTH:02:039:C	Can run
OTH:02:040:C	Don't say you're too tired to fight
OTH:02:041:C	It's just a matter of time (Can run)
OTH:02:042:C	Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
OTH:02:043:C	Don't say you're too tired to fight
OTH:02:044:C	It's just a matter of time (So run)
OTH:02:045:C	Up there's the finish line (And run, and run, and run)
OTH:02:046:I	Only the young
OTH:02:047:I	Only the young
OTH:02:048:I	Only the young
